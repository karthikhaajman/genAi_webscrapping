TCS HELPS ENGIE TRANSITION TO ZERO CARBON
ENERGY, RESOURCES, UTILITIES 
Transition to the zero state
Realizing a net zero vision takes much more than cutting emissions. To create a cleaner and greener future, energy, resources, and utility businesses will have to recraft their operating models and adopt an ecosystem approach. The foundation of these future enterprises will be a resilient digital core that provides certainty and continuity, while the business drives innovation across the value chain. 
Winning the race to net zero is not easy. Partner with us.

WHO WE ARE / SPORTS SPONSORSHIPS
The official partners of passion and purpose
Why we run
Sports sponsorship is aligned with our conviction to be a true transformation partner for our clients, our communities, and the ecosystems we live and work within. Sports that promote wellbeing, like endurance running and all-electric motorsport, are natural partners for us. Every TCS sports sponsorship story emerges from the following pillars: Purpose, Technology, Sustainability.

Tech innovation
Sustainability
Sponsorship with purpose
Sports inspire positive change, drive innovation, and build relationships. We began sponsoring sports for a simple purpose—staying healthy. N. Chandrasekaran, our former CEO and chairman of the Tata group, ran the NYC Marathon in 2009 – it changed his life. He inspired countless people to improve their health through running, and TCS is now the foremost partner of endurance races globally.

QUARTZ™ - THE SMART LEDGERS™
Purpose-driven, meaningful adoption of DLT & AI
In today’s dynamic environment, cutting-edge technologies such as the distributed ledger technology (DLT), and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) have the power to transform the way businesses operate, across industry sectors. In a collaborative model, firms are best served by adopting a philosophy of ‘co-existence’, retaining the best of their existing solutions, and moving appropriate parts of the business to decentralized solutions, while simultaneously driving automation using AI/ML. This approach can help organizations manage risk, save costs, and progressively roll out new services that can harness the power of these technologies. 
Quartz, from TCS, offers solutions that address the entire value chain across the development, integration, and governance of ecosystems. By creating a truly end-to-end solution experience, featuring not only DLT but also AI/ML alongside conventional technologies, Quartz brings the expertise and experience for many enterprises to stride into their next-generation technology journey with confidence.

About Lenovo
One Purpose. One Lenovo.
Smarter Technology for All.
TRANSFORMATION
Smarter Technology for All
Lenovo is a global technology powerhouse, ranked at 217 in the Fortune Global 500, and a $62 billion revenue company that employs 77,000 people worldwide focused on delivering “smarter technology for all”. Building on our success as the world’s number one PC maker, Lenovo is expanding its research into growth areas to advance “New IT” technologies (client, edge, cloud, network, and intelligence).
Learn about who we are >
INNOVATION
Innovation is What We Do Best
Lenovo’s continued investment in innovation and commitment to research and development is changing the way we live and work today and for years to come. Those innovations need to progress in harmony with our planet and its people, and so Lenovo prioritizes corporate citizenship in all that it does - from exploring net-zero emissions to global philanthropy. From cities studded with edge computing cabinets that help stop traffic accidents to a ‘Cyber Space’ room where people interact with life-size objects on a transparent screen, our whole idea of computing is changing. The real and virtual worlds are colliding – not metaphorically, but in a very real way.
Discover what we do >
IMPACT
We’re Committed to Being Good Corporate Citizens
Lenovo is determined to improve our planet and society by minimizing Lenovo’s environmental impact, promoting social equity through its business and via the Lenovo Foundation, and ensuring ethical, responsible, and transparent operations. In January 2023, Lenovo became one of the first group of companies to receive net-zero validation from the Science Based Targets initiative, making it the first PC and smartphone maker and one of only 139 companies around the world with targets validated by the Net-Zero Standard. Lenovo’s goal is to positively impact 15 million people by 2025 through the work of global philanthropy partnerships and programs, led by the Lenovo Foundation.

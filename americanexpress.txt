How does the Business Travel Account work?
Account Set-up
We work with your Travel
Management Company (TMC) to set up your account and capture the data you need.
Book Travel
Your employees book their air travel through your TMC and advise the company’s reference fields (cost centre code, etc.). Your TMC then bills the employees’ air travel to your BTA.
  Receive Statements
You will receive daily unbilled transactions and monthly statements via American Express @Work3, our online tool for expense management. You’ll see all air travel expenses in one simple PDF or Excel document that's easy to filter and sort.
  Reconcile Account
You send a single monthly payment to American Express, reducing time spent reconciling individual payments and extending your payment period up to 51 days2.
  Case study: a consulting firm streamlines its process and cuts costs
The Challenge: A top-tier consulting firm was struggling with outdated and cumbersome travel reconciliation processes. For each trip taken by a field rep, Executive Assistants (EAs) had to spend hours entering data such as traveller names, cost centres and trip details into an Excel spreadsheet, then matching them with specific transactions. The Finance team then had to double-check all this data before reconciling. The process took up to three weeks and was often closed out just as the next monthly billing statement was released.
  The Solution: The American Express Business Travel Account allowed the firm to easily capture traveller names, employee IDs and cost centres for each transaction, dramatically cutting down on administration time for both the Finance team and EAs. As an added bonus, the Finance team was able to contain costs and protect against fraudulent transactions by setting controls around when and how much employees could spend on travel—putting both time and money back into the company.

Our History
With each new development, one thing has remained constant: our commitment to our customers and our special brand of service.
We began as a freight forwarding company in 1850, earning a reputation as a company people could trust while transporting some of their most valuable possessions.

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, we introduced new financial products and travel services that helped support our customers’ everyday lives. In the 1950s, we introduced a charge card, offering customers a new and convenient way to pay. Ever since, we’ve innovated our card products, our services and our other offerings. Today, American Express is a globally integrated payments company and we continue to pride ourselves on being forward-looking and customer-focused.

American Express Founded
Henry Wells, William G. Fargo, and John Butterfield merged their companies to form American Express. Our core business was express delivery of packages, valuables, and other goods. By 1862, we had 890 offices, more than 1,500 colleagues, and a network of nearly 10,000 miles of railway and express routes from the East Coast to Minnesota and Missouri.
Colleague Stories
  At American Express, we know that with the right backing, people and businesses have the power to progress in incredible ways. Whether we’re supporting our customers’ financial confidence to move ahead, taking commerce to new heights, or encouraging people to explore the world, our colleagues are constantly redefining what’s possible — and we’re proud to back each other every step of the way.

Supported studies
Supporting externally-driven studies to further scientific progress and patient care.
Aligned with our mission, GSK conducts research and ensures results are publicly available
To complement GSK sponsored studies, GSK also recognises the key role that supporting external studies play to fulfil patients’ needs. Consequently, we are committed to supporting high standard ethical research conducted by external sponsors that aligns with our scientific areas of interest and further improves the understanding of our products and disease areas of research to enhance patient care.
Supported Studies are conducted by an external Sponsor with GSK’s support. The sponsor of the study is an external investigator, healthcare institution or medical network seeking support from GSK to conduct the study. There are two different ways GSK can provide support:
Investigator Sponsored Studies (also known as Investigator-Initiated Studies, Investigator-Initiated-Trials, Investigator Initiative Research or Investigator Sponsored Research) are research entirely sponsored, designed and managed by an external sponsor. The support provided can be in the form of funding, product (including GSK products, adjuvant for vaccines, placebo, or other medicinal products necessary for the research) or both.

Supported Collaborative Studies are research sponsored and conducted by an external sponsor, which GSK might further support by contributing with study design and deliverables in addition to the provision of funds and /or products. Under specific circumstances, GSK may also provide specialised capabilities or activities.
In both circumstances the sponsor of the research is accountable for all aspects of the study as well as for complying with all applicable ethical, regulatory and legal requirements.

Home Responsibility Access
Access
Our ambition is to positively impact the health of 2.5 billion people by the end of 2030 by making our medicines and vaccines available as widely as possible. We will do this through responsible pricing, strategic access programmes and partnerships.
Putting the right value on innovation
We have a clear commitment to make a real impact on human health and have an industry-leading track record on access to reach patients. Getting the balance right between responsible pricing and sustainable business is fundamental.
We develop pricing strategies based on country-specific circumstances and recognise the need to balance health budgets. In high-income countries, we apply a value-based approach to balance reward for innovation with affordability and price our medicines according to the benefit we bring to patients and health systems, measured by clinical, economic and social outcomes.
In lower income countries, we use innovative pricing structures as part of our access strategies to extend product reach, including tiered pricing for vaccine tenders based on World Bank income classification. We partner with others who have the right capability, geographic reach and local knowledge to get our innovation to patients. For decades, we have worked with partners to strengthen healthcare systems – key to increasing access to medicines in lower income countries.
Access
We are committed to making our products more affordable and available around the world. As well as through responsible pricing we do this through strategic access programmes and partnerships that expand our reach.
Vaccine partnerships
Access to HIV medicines
Going further
We also recognise that we can, and must, do more on access. There are specific challenges faced by people in low- and lower middle- income countries (LLMICs), and so we are working to increase their access to healthcare. Our Global Health activities in LLMICs are a key driver of this as they have the potential to impact 1.3 billion lives.
We are now renewing and extending our commitment to access to patients in LLMICs by applying everything that we have learned to date. This is to expand access to vaccines and medicines from our pipeline and portfolio that have the potential to change the trajectory of high-burden diseases in LLMICs.
We are systematically evaluating our pipeline and portfolio in consultation with global health partners to understand where we can make the most impact. This process will help us identify which products will benefit people most in need in these countries and develop access plans to reach them.
We are committed to continue to improve access, but understand that achieving this ambition will require focus, stamina and will be reached over time.
To achieve this commitment, we are guided by a set principles and key enablers. These include:
Robust and evidence-based process and governance
Prioritising for high impact, driven by local needs, priorities, insights and experience
Ensuring impact and sustainability through innovative partnerships and local capacity building
Recognising that no one size fits all

Home Company Governance
Governance
We are dedicated to maintaining strong corporate governance standards. We believe that our governance structure supports our ability to achieve our strategic goals and create sustainable value for our shareholders and stakeholders.
Our corporate governance architecture
Our corporate governance architecture is designed to enhance the effectiveness of our Board and support their oversight of the GSK Leadership Team (GLT) in delivering our Ahead Together strategy. This framework supports a clear division of responsibilities, appropriate distribution of workload to focused Board committees, and highly committed Directors who are motivated to drive the success of the company.
Our evolving governance framework equips us to navigate industry challenges, maintain our license to operate and drive sustainable growth as a pure biopharma business.
Ahead Together oversight
Our Board focuses on priorities agreed for the year to support delivery of GSK’s corporate strategy encapsulated in our Ahead Together ambitions. Our Board and management agendas are completely aligned with a clear focus on the three time periods that management communicate on – financial performance to 2026, pipeline progress and business development to support the growth ambitions to 2031 as well as the science and technologies that support the long-term growth of the business beyond 2031.
Prioritising engagement
We engage with stakeholders, to understand their expectations and our ever changing landscape. Through ongoing dialogue, we address emerging issues and make decisions to meet their needs. Our Board gathers stakeholder perspectives through multiple channels, including our committees, our leadership team, insights reports, investor discussions, and meetings such as the Annual Governance Meeting and AGM. Our CEO and CFO meet with investors, analysts, and journalists to present our half-year and full-year results. For dividend details, see our dividend calendar.
  Responsible business oversight
Responsible business is embedded in our strategy for sustainable performance and long-term growth. We track progress in six priority areas to build trust: access, global health and health security, environment, inclusion, ethical standards, and product governance. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees and monitors GLT’s progress against these six priority areas to build trust. This includes regularly reviewing our Responsible Business Performance Rating and the detailed Rating metrics. Progress against our priority areas are published annually in our Responsible Business Performance Report.

Improving access to healthcare
Our ambition is to make our medicines and vaccines accessible to those who need them, no matter where they live. 
Nearly two billion people globally still lack access to essential medicines and vaccines that could prevent and treat diseases, relieve suffering, improve quality of life and prevent deaths.
Access to medicines is a key component of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and a critical driver to achieve health equity. Equitable access and resilient health systems are the basis for UHC, by enabling availability, affordability, and acceptability to ensure that people can get the right medicines of the right quality at the right price and at the right place.
Building strong and resilient health systems
Strong and resilient health systems are essential to sustainably reaching our patients and helping to improve their health. A strong health system delivers a broad spectrum of health services to help prevent and treat disease and promote overall wellbeing. A resilient system is one that can prepare for and absorb external shocks, like a disease outbreak, and continue to deliver those services with as little interruption as possible. 
We work with partners and local communities to identify how a health system could be strengthened or made more resilient and collaboratively find and implement solutions.
Our partnerships
Ending neglected tropical diseases
Along with our partners, communities and patients we’ve been working towards ending neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) for over 20 years. Ending NTDs will help people around the world to thrive: they affect more than one billion people, predominantly in remote and marginalised communities, and can be debilitating or fatal.
We have supplied over 12 billion tablets of albendazole, a medicine we developed in-house, which can prevent and treat two NTDs: lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH-intestinal worms). Our contribution has helped the global community make progress towards achieving WHO’s 2030 Road Map goals to prevent, control, eliminate or eradicate the 20 NTDs: 17 countries have eliminated LF as a public health problem, reducing the number of people who need medicines for prevention and treatment by 43%.
We are committed to continue supplying albendazole for LF until it has been eliminated as a public health problem worldwide, and we have extended our donation for STH in school age children through to 2025.
Hear from people who have been impacted by LF and STH and our partners about why we need to end NTDs and what it will take to get there.

Amref Health Africa
Together, GSK and Amref Health Africa have partnered for 30 years to help strengthen health systems across Africa. In 2021 we launched new programmes in Kenya and Ethiopia, focused on strengthening the health systems to reduce the impact of malaria and TB. The programmes address challenges at all levels of the two countries’ health systems: training community health workers, enhancing community health systems and strengthening disease surveillance to inform decision making. They are designed for maximum impact and sustainability and build on the learnings and successes from our decades of partnership.
Learn more about Amref
Save the Children
We joined forces with Save the Children in 2013 to reduce preventable deaths and illness of children under the age of five. Our partnership combines our scientific expertise and Save the Children’s experience in supporting children and mothers’ health and work with communities to deliver long term programmes to improve health. Together, we work on strengthening health systems, responding to emergencies and advocating for global change.
Learn more about Save the children

Emergency response
Every year millions of people are displaced by disasters and humanitarian emergency situations. These crises can devastate families, leaving them without access to adequate food, shelter or healthcare. GSK works with partners and humanitarian organisations to prepare for and respond to emergency situations.
We contribute by donating cash, products and our employees’ time. Sometimes we also invest in long-term rebuilding and reconstruction of health systems in the aftermath of a disaster.
The Humanitarian Mechanism
GSK has supported the Humanitarian Mechanism since it was founded in 2017. The Mechanism is a partnership of UN and civil society organisations – MSF, Save the Children, UNICEF and WHO – which enhances access to vaccines in emergencies by civil society organisations in countries that are not otherwise eligible for Gavi support. Since 2017 we have committed to supplying pneumococcal vaccines, and in 2021 became the first company to offer a rotavirus vaccine through the mechanism.

The opportunity
Healthy people need a healthy planet.
However, there is a negative cycle. When people live with preventable diseases this puts extra pressure on health systems and drives up the environmental footprint of healthcare. Climate change and nature loss are also worsening the global burden of disease.
We are working to break this cycle. Through innovation to prevent and alter disease trajectories, we can not only alleviate the burden on healthcare systems, but also reduce the associated carbon emissions, waste, and water consumption.
At the same time, by harnessing cutting-edge science and technology, we can minimise the climate and nature impacts of the treatments that patients need.
This all helps create more sustainable healthcare systems that are better for patients and the planet.
  Product sustainability
We’re working to deliver more sustainable medicines and vaccines by integrating climate and nature impacts into our product development processes, as part of our plan to achieve our ambitious company goals on both climate and nature.
This involves designing our new products with sustainability in mind and staying ahead of new sustainability challenges as our pipeline and portfolio evolve. Since the beginning of 2024 we now create Sustainable Design Plans for all newly developed or acquired medicines. These help to ensure we understand the environmental impact of each product, and that we have a plan to reduce these impacts across the product lifecycle.
READ OUR APPROACH TO PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY
Reducing the environmental impact of our medicines and vaccines (PDF, 133.8KB)
We are also implementing leading practices throughout our supply chain, manufacturing, and packaging to minimise the impact of our current medicines and vaccines. For GSK, the scale of opportunity is huge – in 2024, we successfully delivered over 1.7 billion packs of medicines and 409 million vaccine doses globally, produced in our 37 manufacturing sites with the support of over 18,000 suppliers.
By leveraging our scientific expertise, technology, and talent, we aim to make our product development more resilient and our processes more efficient, helping to ensure ongoing access to these vital healthcare solutions.

Care model sustainability
We believe that investing in disease prevention is beneficial for patients, communities, health systems and the planet.
By focusing on prevention and changing the course of diseases, we can reduce hospitalisations, staff and patient travel and the need for intensive procedures. This can lessen the carbon emissions, waste, and water usage associated with healthcare, helping health systems to achieve their climate targets.1
Through the development and supply of vaccines, we contribute to preventing diseases such as malaria and RSV. Emerging data highlights the reduced environmental impact of vaccination compared to disease treatment. Additionally, our innovation in longer-acting medicines for respiratory diseases and HIV not only improves patient outcomes but can also reduce the environmental impact of patient care.2
These advancements open up new opportunities for healthcare systems to support patients, manage treatment pathways, and invest in keeping people well while minimising environmental impacts.

Agenda for shared action
Improving sustainability in healthcare is complex, involving collaboration between industry, regulators, payers, healthcare professionals, and patients. We need to collectively ensure the development, uptake, and responsible use of sustainable medicines and vaccines, without compromising efficacy, safety and access.
While the challenges are undeniable, progress is already underway. National governments and health systems are setting climate targets, biodiversity action plans are being formulated, and sustainability criteria are being integrated into health decision-making.
We have identified four immediate priorities to help pave the way towards a shared sustainable future for healthcare. We want to help accelerate these transformations, bring our own learning to the table and expand partnerships with stakeholders to drive change.

History and heritage
It began when Plough Court Pharmacy was established in 1715. Discover GSK’s journey to the organisation we know today.
Overview 1715 to 1908 1909 to 1968 1969 to present Our heritage archives Our archivist story
Overview
Ever since our beginnings at the Plough Court Pharmacy in London in 1715, we’ve aimed to get ahead of the diseases that impact people’s health. Our legacy companies developed a variety of medicines and vaccines that helped to form the building blocks of today’s GSK - a biopharma company that has grown from a handful of individual founders into a company of around 70,000 people.
Glaxo packing room at Bunnythorpe, New Zealand, c.1920
Our innovation history includes 15 pioneering vaccines and medicines
Respiratory, immunology and inflammation
Respiratory, immunology and inflammation
For more than 50 years, we have led the way in developing medicines that advance the management of respiratory conditions, from introducing the world’s first selective short-acting beta agonist in 1969 to launching respiratory medicines and vaccines that make up today’s industry-leading respiratory portfolio. We are investing in innovative science to transform patient outcomes in existing and new respiratory disease areas and are pushing the frontiers of respiratory science to help improve the lives of millions of patients living with respiratory conditions.
Using the science of the immune system and new technologies in ways our predecessors couldn’t have imagined we’re developing differentiated medicines by applying a personalised approach to target the precise biological pathways, factors and traits.
Oncology
Oncology
One of our Nobel Prizewinning researchers, Gertrude Elion, chose to pursue chemistry because her grandfather died of stomach cancer. Her dream was to find a cure for cancer. Elion’s initial research with the company was in purines, which led to several leukaemia treatments in the 1950s. Building on these early advancements in chemotherapies we’ve since made progress in treatments for cancers affecting different parts of the body, as well as reducing the side-effects of chemotherapy. Our novel work in immuno-oncology aims to help the immune system recognise and kill cancer cells more effectively.
HIV
HIV
We've been dedicated to finding treatments for HIV since the virus first emerged in the early 1980s. Since then, we've had many first-in-kind medicines. Our pioneering mindset continues as we lead the way in changing the landscape for people living with HIV/AIDS. 
Innovative entrepreneurs: 1715-1908
Our history began with a remarkable group of individuals in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries who set up a range of innovative, health-focused businesses across the UK, Asia-Pacific and the USA .

Plough Court opens 
Apothecary Silvanus Bevan opened Plough Court pharmacy in 1715, offering medical advice and medicinal products.
Office clerk William Allen joined in 1792, becoming a partner in 1795. A renowned medical professional, Allen was also a founding member of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in 1841.
In 1856 the Plough Court pharmacy became Allen & Hanburys. The company was eventually acquired by Glaxo Laboratories Ltd, one of GSK’s major legacy companies.
SKF receipt, 1895
The origins of “Smith Kline”
In 1830 the Smith & Gilbert drug house opened in Philadelphia, USA. After Gilbert withdrew, John K. Smith’s younger brother George joined, helping to build a successful drug wholesaling business.
By 1870, their nephew Mahlon Smith was managing the company and its bookkeeper, Mahlon Kline had joined as partner to form Smith, Kline & Co. In 1891 they acquired French, Richards & Co. to form Smith, Kline & French Co. 
Pill making room, 1890s
From shepherd boy to factory owner
Former shepherd Thomas Beecham opened his first shop in the north of England in 1848. He developed the recipe for Beecham’s laxative pills before building what was claimed to be the first factory in the UK with electricity in 1887.
A provider of healthcare products across the UK, Beecham eventually diversified into pharmaceutical research with a focus on antibiotics, merging with SmithKline Beckman Corp. to form SmithKline Beecham plc.
  Defiance factory at Bunnythorpe, NZ, c.1904
Necessities in New Zealand 
In 1873, Joseph Nathan, a Londoner, established general trading company Joseph Nathan & Co. in New Zealand.
Investing their profits in land used for dairy farms, the Nathan family found a way to dry thousands of litres of fresh milk, selling the product under the ‘Defiance’ brand before settling on ‘Glaxo’ in 1906.
Joseph Nathan & Co. Ltd. was bought out by its subsidiary Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. in 1947.

Partners in pharmaceuticals
In 1880, American pharmacists Henry S. Wellcome and Silas M. Burroughs founded Burroughs Wellcome & Co in London.
Focusing strongly on biological experimentation with vaccines, The Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories were established in 1894.
Within a decade the Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories to study infectious diseases of the tropical regions were founded in Sudan, including a floating mobile lab with pathology services on the White Nile.

As technological advancements were revolutionising the wider world, our legacy companies were also expanding, developing and selling new products on an increasingly global scale. It was a period of landmark scientific breakthroughs, including the discovery of insulin and penicillin.

Crossing continents
Our legacy companies supported a wave of exploration expeditions in the early twentieth century. Burroughs Wellcome & Co.’s medical chests accompanied the first transatlantic air crossing and expeditions to the Amazon, Arctic, Antarctic and Mount Everest.

New discovery: insulin
In 1921 insulin was discovered as a way of managing diabetes. Legacy companies Burroughs Wellcome and Allen & Hanburys were among the first to reproduce the hormone for commercial use in the UK.  
By 1923, Allen & Hanburys were producing 95% of the country’s insulin. However by 1924, Burroughs Wellcome had modified their processes to produce insulin on a large scale from cow pancreas.

Glaxo's first pharma product
Joseph Nathan & Co.’s first chemist, Harry Jephcott, licensed a method to produce a Vitamin D supplement in 1924. They sold it as Ostelin - their first pharmaceutical product.
The research side of the business grew and in 1935 a subsidiary company, Glaxo Laboratories Ltd was established. By 1947 Glaxo had surpassed its parent in terms of sales and product range and bought out Joseph Nathan & Co.
  Sir Henry Dale
Medical discoveries
In 1924, Henry Wellcome combined Burroughs Wellcome & Co. with his charitable and research pursuits to form the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. Upon his death in 1936, ownership of the foundation passed to the Wellcome Trust.
The Trust’s first chairman was Sir Henry Dale, former director of the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories. In 1936, Dale was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his landmark discovery relating to the chemical transmission of nerve impulses.

Penicillin
Penicillin was developed into an antibiotic in the late 1930s. By 1944, 80% of UK penicillin production was being routed through Glaxo’s Greenford site.
In 1945 Beecham Group established their research arm, Beecham Research Laboratories, with a focus on antibiotics. Twelve years later Beecham scientists discovered the penicillin nucleus – the core of the molecule, known as 6-APA. From this nucleus they determined they could develop new penicillin.

Nobel Prize-winning discoveries 
At Burroughs Wellcome & Co., the Wellcome Foundation’s US subsidiary, Dr. George Hitchings’ research team made a series of important discoveries over a thirty-year period.
Starting in the early 1950s, these included drugs for malaria and our first oncology drug for leukaemia. Drugs for gout, viral infections and to prevent organ transplantation rejection followed.  
Hitchings, along with colleague Gertrude Elion, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988.

The progression of polio vaccines
Three of our legacy companies, Glaxo Laboratories, the Wellcome Foundation and Recherche et Industrie Thérapeutiques of Belgium, sold inactivated polio vaccines from 1956. In the early 1960s oral polio vaccines were developed, drops of which were traditionally given on sugar cubes.
The introduction of polio vaccines globally helped to eradicate two strains of the virus. The remaining wild strain is subject to a global eradication order from the WHO.

Glaxo takes on asthma 
After Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. acquired Allen & Hanburys Ltd, a new R&D team led to our first asthma medicine being introduced in 1969, followed by the first steroid-based preventer drug three years later.
In subsequent decades improved molecules for relievers and preventers were introduced, with the first inhaler to contain both launched in 1997.
Our most recent dry powder inhaler device in 2013 was worked on by over 200 scientists and engineers.

Expansion in antibiotics
After Beecham’s discovery of the penicillin nucleus, they began designing semi-synthetic penicillin. Two major drugs came out of this - a broad-spectrum antibiotic in 1972 and a more bacteria-resistant drug in 1981. Both appear on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines.
At the same time, Glaxo were investigating cephalosporin-based antibiotics. The first cephalosporin-C based drug was launched in 1964 and several others were introduced over the next two decades.

Advances in HIV 
In the early 1980s the team at Burroughs Wellcome & Co. (USA) dedicated themselves to finding an effective treatment for HIV. Marty St. Clair discovered one in 1984, and it was made available to patients in early 1987.
Through the 1990s and 2000s we continued to develop and launch single and combination HIV medications, as well as medicines for HIV-related problems such as AIDS-related pneumonia.
The merger is announced, Jan 2000
The formation of GSK
In 1989, SmithKline Beckman Corp. merged with Beecham Group plc to form SmithKline Beecham plc.
In the mid-1980s, the Wellcome Trust publicly sold shares of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. to form Wellcome plc. In 1995 the Trust sold the remaining shares to Glaxo plc, forming the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, Glaxo Wellcome plc.
In January 2000, it was announced that Glaxo Wellcome plc was to merge with SmithKline Beecham plc to form GlaxoSmithKline plc.
  Commitment to people living with HIV
In 2009, a unique partnership with Pﬁzer led to the launch of ViiV Healthcare, a company focused on delivering advanced treatment and care for HIV communities.
Using the expertise of both companies and Shionogi, a Japanese pharmaceutical company who joined in 2012, ViiV Healthcare now has a portfolio of sixteen HIV treatments and preventative drugs.

Novel vaccines on a global scale
Our legacy research in malaria dates back over a century. In 2014 we submitted a file to the European Medicines Agency for the world’s first malaria candidate vaccine. Since 2018, the vaccine has been used in countries across Africa.
Partly through the acquisition of Affinivax in 2022, GSK is using MAPS technology and Generalized Modules for Membrane Antigens (GMMA)  to help build new vaccines quicker.
Progress in oncology treatments
The acquisitions of Tesaro and Sierra Oncology meant we further strengthened our oncology portfolio and pipeline, with treatments for blood and women’s cancers.
Our research into immuno-oncology, a type of therapy that uses the body’s own immune system to treat cancer, marks an incredibly exciting period for the next phase of GSK’s commitment to helping advance the field of oncology care.
The GSK of today
GSK plc underwent a transformation in 2022, separating its consumer healthcare business to establish Haleon plc as an independent listed company.
This marked a new chapter for GSK as a focused biopharma company, dedicated to the development of innovative medicines and vaccines.
Our Ahead Together strategy embodies our commitment to unite science, technology and talent to intervene early, prevent and change the course of disease, helping to protect people and support healthcare systems.
GSK's heritage archives
GSK traces its earliest foundation to London in 1715, with the opening of the Plough Court pharmacy. This makes us the longest continually running British pharmaceutical company.
Our heritage archives document the contribution we and our legacy companies have made to the world’s health and our impact on science, industry, culture and the community.

About the archives
Our collections are mainly housed in London. They contain approximately 370 linear metres of material relating to our legacy companies. These include Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo, Allen & Hanburys, SmithKline & French and Beecham, along with many other smaller subsidiaries.
These records also feature information about products and brands, business and financial documents and sites from 1747 to present.
The GSK heritage archives can accommodate some external researchers and remote requests. Requests for access to the archives or information contained in the collections will be considered on an individual basis. 
Contact our archivists by email: heritage.archives@gsk.com 
Our collections showcase the range of scientific advances our predecessors were at the forefront of, and the impact our innovations have had on the world’s health over the past 300 years.
Jill Moretto, Heritage Archive Manager
Our archivist story
Jill Moretto is one of our heritage archivists who lo­­­oks after thousands of items collected throughout GSK’s 300 year history, from historical documents to an embalmed cow’s pancreas. Here she tells us about the fascinating items hiding in our archives.
When I tell people I am an archivist at GSK, they are usually shocked that the company has an archive. Then they assume that we are like archivists in dusty vaults that they have seen on TV. Does it surprise you that we do actually make it out into daylight?!
Our collections consist of records, artefacts, books and papers which are split between two sites in the UK and USA. I also regularly spend days in our head office in London. It’s not all white gloves - I am the clumsiest person you will ever meet; as an archive volunteer I once unrolled a very long and wide paper scroll which promptly ripped in half!
Jill Moretto is one of our heritage archivists
A typical day in the archives
My life at GSK began four years ago. I was initially brought in for a month to stocktake our collection, and I never left. I’m now a fully qualified archivist. When I am in the office I handle enquiries, research our collection and organise our digital images and videos into the same structure as the paper records.
Jill Moretto
When I am in the archive I do deeper research for enquiries, whether it’s checking records and making notes or scanning a photo for someone. I also do tours and talks about the company history, and show off some of our records and artefacts like an inhaler from the 1900s.
It’s a real joy to look after such a wealth of historical records. Astonishingly, when you combine the amount of historical materials within our two bases it adds up to 370 metres, nearly the height of the Empire State Building.
The importance of preserving our company history
Our unique heritage collection tells the story of the company, the pharmaceutical industry, and medical research over several centuries, as well as the people and communities who worked in these areas. We are still involved in many areas of research featured within our collection. The information can help guide and inform us, as well as demonstrating our proven track record in those areas.
The Coronation festival
We share the collections at celebrations, community exhibitions and in publications. Our Horlicks products were displayed at the Buckingham Palace Coronation festival to show how we supported early polar expeditions. As a high-calorie food supplement, Horlicks was included in emergency packs for polar explorers. Mountaineer Richard Byrd even named the Horlicks Mountains on the Ross Ice Shelf in honour of our $30,000 sponsorship. The drink made its way to both the North and South Poles on expeditions.
As we continue to add to our archive, we add to our legacy. By maintaining our archives, GSK shows the importance we place on preserving and sharing our history.
My personal jewels of the collection
Finding a favourite item among the vast collection is tough. Top of my list is a collection of records owned by Sir Harry Jephcott. He retired as CEO and Chairman in 1956, but remained as Honorary President of Glaxo. During that time, he intended to write a short history of the company and assembled all the records he needed into one collection. Over the past 50 years this collection has been mislaid and jumbled; but I recently succeeded in rebuilding it.
The large pancreas in the archive
Another favourite is a giant preserved pancreas. Wellcome (one of GSK’s legacy companies) were one of the first companies in the UK to produce insulin from beef pancreas. When one pancreas was the largest they’d ever seen - two or three times larger than usual - they decided to preserve it in formalin, a yellow liquid. It’s hideous!
I often get visitors on the tour I run of the archive who say 'show me something weird', so I head straight for the pancreas.

Home Responsibility Ethical standards Public policy and patient advocacy
Public policy and patient advocacy
Information on our lobbying and public policy activity.
Political advocacy Patient advocacy Patient organisation funding
  We engage with governments, policymakers, multilateral agencies and professional associations to advocate for policies that protect the interests of patients. We also engage with and support patient organisations to gain insights from patients, to help us develop medicines and advocate for policies that better meet their needs.
We aim to demonstrate that all our interactions with political stakeholders and patient organisations are conducted appropriately, ethically and transparently. Our Global Standard for Interacting with Patient Organisations gives clarity on our approach.
Political advocacy
We interact regularly with governments, policymakers and other stakeholders to advocate for policies that encourage innovation, promote efficient management of healthcare spending and give patients the support they need. All employees involved in lobbying activities must follow the relevant requirements set out in our Code . We also expect any third-party policy groups that engage on our behalf to share our values, and we have comprehensive criteria to guide the selection of these groups. We register lobbying costs on the EU Transparency Register and the US Federal Lobbying Register. Further disclosures regarding our advocacy spend in the US and Europe are available in our Responsible Business Performance Report 2024.
Our policy position on Political Advocacy
Patient advocacy
Vaccines and medicines provide significant benefits for individual patients and for public health. In order to realise these benefits, we need to interact with external groups throughout the research, development and marketing of our medicines and vaccines. This enables us to use the expertise of patients, scientists, doctors and other healthcare professionals to better understand how to conduct the most effective research, how to make treatment advances and how to meet patient needs. In some instances, these interactions involve GSK providing funding to patient organisations. We know these relationships can cause concern and we therefore aim to be transparent about the payments we make and what they are for.
Patient organisation funding
We provide funding to patient organisations to help with day-to-day running costs and specific events or activities. Our support also includes educational assistance, training for staff, and collaboration on disease awareness and prevention projects.
Our relationships with patient organisations help us to better understand patient needs and their illnesses, which also guides our R&D. In turn, our support helps patient opinions to be heard in the healthcare debate. Grants and funding from GSK cannot exceed 25% of a patient organisation’s annual revenue and we do not exert undue influence or promote our products to these organisations (unless permissible under local laws and regulations).
Find details of our work with patient organisations in our US, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Emerging Markets regions, as well as what funding we provide for patient organisations working globally.

Home Innovation Research and development approach
Research and development approach
R&D is central to our purpose to get ahead of disease together. By combining the science of the immune system with cutting-edge technology, we can discover and develop new medicines and vaccines that will transform people’s lives.
R&D is the core of our innovation
The convergence of science and technology is changing discovery and development, allowing us to make advances once thought impossible. We have built one of the world’s largest genetic datasets, giving us an unprecedented level of understanding of the human immune system and end-to-end insight into the underlying biology of disease. This gives us a transformative opportunity to predict and pre-empt disease and propel all aspects of R&D, reflected in our broad pipeline.
We have bolstered our pipeline and technology capabilities through strategic business development, actively seeking out new, differentiated opportunities in diseases with high patient need. In 2024, we invested £6.4bn in R&D across our portfolio. We have approximately 71 medicines and vaccines in development, further strengthening our position as a pioneer in the field of healthcare innovation.
Our world-leading capabilities in medicines and vaccines development are driven by our commitment to making a significant and meaningful impact on patients' lives. We strive to deliver innovative solutions by combining scientific potential, addressing unmet patient needs, and considering commercial value. We are committed to developing treatments that make a real difference and create value for patients and shareholders.
Our priorities in R&D are:
execution: to accelerate our pipeline, including with business development, to deliver innovative medicines and vaccines
technology: to deliver more innovation, better and faster, using new data and platform technologies that speed discovery and development and improve the chance of success
culture: to create an agile, innovative environment that’s ambitious for patients and attracts the best people, scientists and partners.

Global supply chain
Our global supply chain is critical to manufacturing and supplying reliable, high-quality medicines and vaccines to meet patients’ needs and drive our performance. It includes 37 medicines and vaccines manufacturing sites which help to make a positive impact on the health of millions of people.
It is vital for innovation too. Supply chain teams are part of how we prevent and change the course of disease, bringing our innovations to patients as quickly, efficiently and effectively as possible. They’re involved early in product and process development, working with R&D to make sure that what works in clinical trials can be scaled up to commercial production.
Technology is transforming how we manufacture medicines and vaccines, enabling us to increase the speed, quality and scale of product supply. We’re using data to help us monitor production in real time, spot ways to increase yields and predict when equipment needs maintenance. We’re using smart manufacturing technologies for greater efficiency, productivity, sustainability and cost savings. We can augment our human creativity, expertise and problem solving with data and AI, increasing our impact and delivering better and faster for patients.

Health security
We’re uniting science, technology and talent to get ahead of health security threats.
Health security is defined as the actions needed to prevent and respond to acute threats that could endanger people’s health across countries and borders
There are many factors that can jeopardise our health security – from new and emerging infectious diseases to the rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Climate change and nature loss also pose a risk as they weaken the natural ecosystems on which our health depends. Increased global travel, political instability and fragile health systems can all exacerbate these threats.
As a global company innovating to prevent and mitigate infectious disease, strengthening health security is core to our purpose. Protecting people and health systems from infectious disease threats helps to safeguard lives and livelihoods, as well as support our business model. So, we are using our scientific know-how and collaborating with others to help the world better prepare for future health challenges such as disease outbreaks with pandemic potential and AMR.

Dr Tony Wood
Chief Scientific Officer
Tony Wood, GSK’s Chief Scientific Officer since 2022, leads all Research and Development activities across GSK’s portfolio and pipeline, with a specific focus on driving delivering of new, innovative medicines and vaccines that bring transformative impact for patients in areas of high unmet need. He leads a global organisation focused across four core therapeutic areas (infectious disease, HIV, respiratory/immunology, and oncology) and driven by three R&D priorities – Execution, Technology and Culture – all central to developing an R&D approach based on science of the immune system, human genetics and advanced technologies, notably building ground-breaking in-house capabilities in functional genomics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as through focused business development or partnering.  
Tony is one of the world’s pre-eminent medicinal chemists and has the rare distinction of inventing one of the first mammalian host protein-targeted anti-HIV drugs to reach the market. As a pioneer of structure-based drug design to overcome problems of resistance, he has striven to advance strategies in medicinal chemistry design, including ligand efficiency and lipophilic efficiency, structural-property relationships for toxicity, and the use of chemoinformatics to inform molecule and library design.  
He is a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry. Tony has a BSc in chemistry and a PhD in organic synthesis from Newcastle University. 
Follow Tony on LinkedIn
  There’s never been a time when science and technology have formed such a powerful union as they do now. We’re able to identify drug targets using genomics and AI/ML in a way that is unprecedented. We are also able to use more approaches than ever before to design new vaccines and medicines to address the root cause of disease.

Representative clinical studies
Diseases and medicines can affect people differently depending on their ethnicity, sex, race and age so we need to make sure that our clinical trials include those affected by the disease under study. This supports our business performance by providing healthcare providers and the individuals who are prescribed our medicines and vaccines confidence in the safety and effectiveness of our products. Since 2022, all our phase III clinical trials have representation plans in place before commencing enrolment to reflect the people most impacted by a particular disease.
Now, our focus is on actual enrolment of participants impacted by the disease under study. 88% of phase III trials completing enrolment in 2024 met our enrolment thresholds needed so that trial participants represent the disease epidemiology under study.

Home Responsibility Environment Land
Land
Land is a key part of our nature goal and spans both our operations and value chain. On this page we detail our land targets and how we aim to achieve them.
Our land targets
Positive impact on biodiversity at all sites1 by 2030
100% of key naturally-derived materials sustainably sourced and deforestation free by 20302
1 GSK sites
2 Definition clarified in 2024 to reflect priority materials
How we plan to achieve our land targets
Biodiversity at GSK sites
We have committed to positive biodiversity at GSK-owned sites by 2030 and have completed baseline biodiversity assessments for all of our sites using the Natural England Biodiversity Net Positive methodology. Sites are investing in biodiversity programmes to improve habitats, protect species and improve soil or water quality. This might include tree planting, adding bird boxes on-site and pond maintenance. In 2024, we delivered projects to restore native fauna at our Ware, Wavre, Zebulon and Evreux manufacturing sites, with the aim of achieving a biodiversity uplift.
We’re also contributing to broader landscape restoration in the regions where our sites are located. In 2024, through Projects for Nature’s we supported the Living Rivers project in the UK, that aims to restore chalk streams in Hertfordshire, a region where three of our sites are located.
We know that making nature easily accessible improves mental and physical wellbeing. Investing in site biodiversity is also investing in health and wellbeing for our people, as well as supporting team building as people can get involved with local projects.
Sustainable and deforestation-free sourcing
Our target is that 100% of key naturally-derived materials sustainably sourced and deforestation free by 20301
Our primary dependency on land is due to the natural materials we source, some of which derive from land-based commodities, a key driver of deforestation and land use change, globally. The supply chains for some of these commodities are often long and complex and may be many tiers removed from our direct engagement.
While we work on avoiding or reducing impact by assessing opportunities to improve efficiency, material changes or switching to alternatives, we have set ambitious standards for suppliers who provide us with materials that are highly dependent on nature, such as sugar, paper, palm oil, lactose, gelatine and soy.
These standards, developed in collaboration with third-party experts, aim to support these suppliers to assess, improve, and verify their approach to addressing a range of nature impacts – and associated climate and social impacts – including land-use, water stewardship and biodiversity.
As a first stage, we are addressing the 12 highest priority materials, including paper and palm oil. We have roadmaps in place with an aim to achieve 100% paper packaging and palm oil certified by 2025.
We have engaged with associated suppliers to map the full supply chains involved, understand existing sustainability standards, identify gaps and establish action plans.
Sustainable sourcing standards
  1Definition clarified in 2024 to reflect priority materials
  Investing in nature
We will also invest in the protection and restoration of land use across and beyond our value chain, in a way that also contributes to carbon removal and water basin restoration – further helping us to achieve our climate and water targets.
For example, GSK is a participant of the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest finance (LEAF) Coalition, which supports high-quality emissions avoidance from tropical and subtropical forest countries, helping to reduce and end deforestation and protect future biodiversity.

Transformative potential from PARPs
Our strong belief is that PARP inhibitors are important medicines that have been under appreciated in terms of the impact they can have on cancer patients. PARP inhibitors have transformed the treatment of ovarian cancer and offer significant opportunities for use in the treatment of multiple cancer types.
PARP inhibitors may slow the return or progress of cancer by preventing cancer cells from repairing damaged DNA in cells
PARP inhibitors have transformed the treatment of ovarian cancer, particularly those with genetic mutations such as BRCA
PARPs are currently used in second line maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer and show potential to help 2-3 times as many patients in a first line maintenance setting

Home Responsibility Ethical standards
Ethical standards
Our culture guides our people to behave in an ethical way, to do the right thing and act on any concerns they have. It’s important that all our people live up to this, and we expect the same of our suppliers.
Supporting GSK people to do the right thing
We are committed to operating responsibly and we expect that everyone who works for us, or on our behalf, conducts themselves in the right way and in line with our Code.
The Code (PDF, 464KB)
Policies and standards (PDF, 238KB)
Compliance
All individuals working at GSK have to complete our ‘Working at GSK’ training programme, which details what our company expects from employees. Our people also receive additional anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) training. This helps them to identify and mitigate any potential ABAC risk - especially in third-party relationships - and to recognise, report and manage conflicts of interest. Our people also complete mandatory annual conduct training which outlines our zero tolerance of harassment in any form and gives guidance on the support and advice available.
Everyone working inside or outside of GSK can raise concerns or speak to an independent third party through our integrity lines, without fear of retaliation. We take all concerns very seriously and review each report to see whether we need to investigate formally. If our investigations show an employee has breached our policies, we will take action accordingly.

The Notice of Annual General Meeting 2025 (2025 AGM Notice) gives details on the resolutions to be put to the AGM, along with explanatory notes.
A resolution will be put to shareholders to approve the renewal of the GSK Share Value Plan for eligible employees. The rules of the new share plan can be found here.

Full details on how to participate in the AGM, ask questions and vote before and during the meeting can be found on pages 26 to 30 of the 2025 AGM Notice, and in our AGM Guide. They are also summarised below.
Any shareholders with questions on how to access the AGM should contact our registrar, Computershare, who will be pleased to talk through the joining options. Their contact details can be found on page 34 of the 2025 AGM Notice and on our investor contacts page.

Any questions concerning meeting logistics or your own shareholding should be directed to Computershare whose contact details can be found on page 34 of the 2025 AGM Notice and on our investor contacts page.

Home Products Product areas
Our product areas
Our portfolio is made up of specialty medicines, vaccines and general medicines. These are the three different types of products we create to prevent and treat disease.
Health impact Specialty medicines Vaccines General medicines Our supply chain
Health impact
We prevent and treat disease with specialty medicines, vaccines and general medicines. We focus on the science of the immune system and the use of new platform and data technologies, investing in four core therapeutic areas: respiratory, immunology and inflammation; oncology; HIV; infectious diseases. Our Ahead Together strategy means intervening early to prevent and change the course of disease, helping to protect people and support healthcare systems. We’re confident in our future. With our strong momentum and improving outlook for sustained growth through the decade, we're confident in our ability to deliver human health impact at scale, worldwide.
Specialty medicines
Specialty medicines are prescribed by specialist healthcare practitioners. Our portfolio of specialty medicines prevents and treats diseases, from HIV to respiratory diseases, immune-mediated conditions like lupus, and cancer. We’re leaders in infectious diseases and HIV innovation and we’re building our positions in immunology and oncology.

Global health and health security
We have a unique and important role to play in improving health for patients around the world and helping the world to prepare for future health security challenges. Actions on these will support growth, build trust with our stakeholders, help us attract and retain outstanding people, reduce risk and enable delivery of positive social impact.
Our ambition
We have a unique and important role to play in improving health for patients around the world and helping the world prepare for future health security challenges. Actions on these will support growth, build trust with our stakeholders, help us attract and retain outstanding people, reduce risk and enable delivery of positive social impact.
Hundreds of millions of people around the world live with unmet health needs. Using our science, our partnerships, and the knowledge we’ve gained from addressing the world’s biggest health challenges, we want to help change this.
Our commitment to improving our global health impact through R&D for infectious diseases and access to medicines and vaccines has been recognised in the Access to Medicine Index, where we have ranked number one in all eight waves since its inception.
Our ambition is contingent on reaching people all around the globe with the products they need to thrive and prosper, and by helping the global community to better prepare for emerging health security threats and challenges.
How we’re getting Ahead Together for global health
We have a dedicated Global Health team of more than 200 outstanding people. In 2022, with ViiV Healthcare, we announced an investment of £1 billion over 10 years to accelerate global health R&D. By the end of 2023, we had invested 21% and progressed 11 Global Health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases, including climate aggravated diseases that disproportionately affect lower income countries.
  Global health
Preparing for future health challenges
We are using our scientific know-how and partnerships to help the world better prepare for future health challenges, such as disease outbreaks with pandemic potential and antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
Without action on AMR 10 million people could die from drug-resistant infections every year by 2050. That’s why we have more than 30 R&D projects across medicines and vaccines that are relevant to AMR, ranging from early- to late-stage development. 12 of these projects target pathogens deemed ‘critical’ or ‘urgent’ by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We’re also working with governments, NGOs and other stakeholders to bolster future pandemic responses, strengthen efforts to get ahead of AMR and build more resilient healthcare systems able to cope with health security challenges.

Using our science for global health
We develop new ways to prevent and treat high burden diseases in lower-income countries with a focus on infectious diseases.
Our £1bn investment over ten years is helping accelerate global health R&D, focusing on new vaccines and medicines to help prevent and treat malaria, TB, diseases driving AMR and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).  We have two R&D hubs focused on developing a world-leading global health pipeline.
Our Global Health Medicines R&D is based in Tres Cantos, Spain, and is focused on developing its industry-leading pipeline in TB, malaria and NTDs. In TB we're finding shorter and simpler combinations to tackle resistance and in malaria, we're focused on developing new and innovative tools to get ahead of disease. 
The GSK Vaccines Institute for Global Health (GVGH) in Siena, Italy, leads our strong vaccine portfolio focused on preventing enteric and diarrhoeal diseases.  The team is also focused on exploring novel technologies for lower income countries for example GMMA, and developing a next-generation malaria vaccine. 
By the end of 2024, we had invested 33% of our £1bn investment and progressed 6 global health pipeline assets to address priority WHO diseases, including climate aggravated diseases that disproportionately affect lower income countries.1

How we’re finding new ways to prevent and treat malaria
View on YouTube
30 January 2025
Our focus
Our global health R&D pipeline aims to deliver transformative medicines and vaccines and our efforts are focused on the highest burden diseases in lower income countries: malaria, TB, HIV (through ViiV Healthcare) AMR and NTDs and viral threats. 
Malaria
We support the global elimination of malaria by improving prevention and treatment for children and vulnerable populations. Our industry-leading pipeline is looking at developing novel antimalarial medicines to tackle resistance and exploring a next-generation malaria vaccine.
Tuberculosis
Our focus is on transforming how TB is prevented and treated to contribute to ending the epidemic. Our TB medicines pipeline includes potential treatments that could be shorter and active against drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains of TB.  
Antimicrobial resistance
By finding new ways to prevent infectious diseases, we aim to reduce the burden of AMR to contribute to long-term health security. Our global health portfolio is focused on enteric and diarrhoeal diseases and other high-burden pathogens including typi/paratyphi and invasive nontyphoidal salmonella (iNTS).
NTDs and viral threats
We are helping contribute to the elimination and control of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and viral threats while expanding access to GSK assets. We carry out targeted R&D for the highest need NTDs and viral threats, currently focused on visceral leishmaniasis.

Our R&D partnerships
It is through partnership that we can focus where we add most value. Our scientific innovation and expertise enable us to advance multiple assets simultaneously across a range of diseases. As a result of our collaborative approach to global health R&D we have developed and delivered some significant interventions.
In partnership with organisations including PATH and the World Health Organization, RTS,S/ASO1 – the world’s first malaria vaccine – began rolling out in malaria-endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa in 2024 after three decades of development.
Our collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture has seen tafenoquine (Krintafel/Kozensis), the first single-dose medicine for the prevention of relapse of Plasmodium vivax malaria, prequalified by the WHO in 2024. This followed the introduction of tafenoquine in Brazil and Thailand in June 2024. GSK’s legacy in the R&D of tafenoquine as a potential medicine for malaria started over 20 years ago.
GVGH scientists led the development of a typhoid conjugate vaccine and in January 2020, the asset was licensed to our partner Biological E for the prevention of typhoid fever in endemic countries. In December 2020, this vaccine obtained WHO prequalification and began rolling out in Nepal in 2022, reaching over 7m children when introduced into its routine childhood vaccination programme.
Developing a new vaccine against TB in lower income countries is a global health priority to accelerate progress toward ending the TB epidemic. In conjunction with IAVI, we developed M72 – the first vaccine candidate against TB in 100 years – and licensed it to the Bill & Melinda Gates Medical Research Institute in 2020 for continued development and ongoing collaboration. In 2024, phase 3 trials got underway in Africa and Southeast Asia.
      Supporting open innovation to advance global health R&D
Our commitment to advancing global health R&D extends beyond our own work. As founders of the Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation, we support scientists from around the world to join us at our Tres Cantos R&D hub to pursue their own projects as part of an integrated team. They can access our expertise, processes, and industrial-scale infrastructure to further their research into infectious diseases which predominantly affect low- and lower middle- income countries. A significant pipeline of candidate medicines has been delivered through this model – including a novel TB drug candidate with treatment shortening potential.
We have also established the GVGH Innovation Academy, focusing on future technologies for global health vaccines in partnership with academic institutions.

References
The methodology for calculating our patient reach impact is derived from a detailed product level analysis of actual sales and long-range forecasts by individual countries. It purely accounts for the number of people receiving a GSK product (reach), not the outcomes or benefits they derive. The analysis uses conservative assumptions to ensure people are only counted once, even if they experience two or more of GSK’s vaccines or medicines during the 10-year period. The methodology and the data have been reviewed and validated externally. Budget phasing is not linear across the 10-year period.

Home Responsibility Ethical standards Working with third parties
Working with third parties
We work with thousands of third parties across all areas of our business. On this page we detail our third-party policies and practices.
Choosing the right suppliers Working with Third Parties policy Third-Party Risk Management Additional support
  Our suppliers and other third parties – including agents, distributors and affiliate companies (where we have an equity stake) – help us research, develop, manufacture and distribute the medicines, vaccines and other products that patients need.
Choosing the right suppliers
GSK’s supply chains are complex and have significant scale – we spend billions of pounds with tens of thousands of suppliers on a wide range of goods and services. It is essential that we have strong relationships with suppliers and third parties that are critical to our business and work with those that share our values and operate in a responsible and ethical way.
How our third parties act can have a direct impact on us meeting our priorities. It is important to manage our relationships with them well, including the way we choose, contract and monitor them.
Selecting suppliers that can ensure a continuous supply of materials of the appropriate quality is critical, as is controlling the conditions in which products are transported. Maintaining resilient supply chains is particularly important because changing suppliers - especially those that are part of a regulatory dossier - can be complex, slow and expensive.
Our Working with Third Parties policy
The standards we expect of suppliers are set out as principles in our Working with Third Parties policy. All third parties must meet our anti-bribery and corruption and labour rights standards and, where relevant, we expect them to comply with our standards on quality, health and safety, and the environment.
  Policy position on working with third parties(PDF - 316.8KB)
Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) programme
Our Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) programme evaluates and mitigates the risks introduced through engaging third parties to provide goods or services for GSK. We complete assessments for the portion of our third parties that may present greater potential risk, for example, interactions with government officials or annual transfers of value above certain pre-defined limits.
Additional support
We give extra support to our suppliers who are active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) suppliers with whom we have significant spend, and/or are medically or R&D critical to the business. We visit sites, in person or virtually, to help suppliers better understand and control their risks. These site visits are carried out by GSK as well as independent, accredited, third party auditing bodies. We also use tools to assess how suppliers manage EHS risks, including EcoVadis desktop assessments. We set EHS requirements for suppliers, tell them when they fall short, and review their EHS performance, and support them in implementing their action plans, as part of our internal EHS governance and oversight.
We also help suppliers improve safety and overall capability, focusing mainly on Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) manufacturers and contract manufacturing suppliers. We have also trained suppliers on EHS topics, revised EHS contractual obligations and tracked management actions until they were completed.
Paying our suppliers
We have a responsibility to support our suppliers by paying on time. We have put in place an exception to our standard payment terms for small and medium-sized companies in the UK, and small diverse suppliers in the USA. 
You can find out more about this initiative on the getting paid section of our supplier website. We have a number of other initiatives underway to continuously improve the experience of suppliers who work with us. As part of our commitment to diversity and inclusion, in the UK and US we support suppliers by groups that are under-represented in the supply chain; such as those owned by women, minorities and disabled veterans. Through our supplier diversity programmes, we engage with and mentor small and diverse businesses in our supply chain and help them identify potential areas for growth.

Asset reunification - Georgeson
We run a tracing programme in partnership with Georgeson, with the aim of reuniting 'lost' shareholders or their estates with unclaimed cash entitlements in respect of payments made by GSK, Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham.
There are various reasons why cash entitlements may not have been claimed by shareholders.

The most common reasons are:
Shareholder not notifying the registrar of a change of address; or
Where a shareholder is deceased and the beneficiaries or executors of an estate are not aware of the holding.
If you would like to clarify whether you or a deceased person for whose estate you act holds shares in GSK (or held shares in Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham), please contact our registrar, Computershare for further assistance. Their contact details can be found on the Investors contact details page.

Home Responsibility Environment Atmosphere
Atmosphere
On this page we detail our atmosphere targets and how we aim to achieve them.
Our atmosphere targets
100% imported renewable electricity by 2025 and 100% renewable electricity (imported and generated) by 2030 (Scope 2)
80% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions1 from a 2020 baseline, across all scopes2 and investment in nature-based solutions for the remaining 20% of our footprint by 2030
Net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain by 2045: 90% absolute reduction in emissions from a 2020 baseline, across all scopes and all residual emissions neutralised.
1 Previously stated as net zero by 2030
2 This is a new longer-term target, aligned to the SBTi Net-Zero Standard definition of net zero
How we plan to achieve our atmosphere targets
Improving air quality
As a leader in medicines and vaccines for respiratory health, we want to play our part in improving air quality. We have done an initial assessment to establish an air pollution footprint in our operations and our supply chain. This showed that, directly, we are having a relatively low impact on air quality, and that the largest proportion of our emissions sit in our supply chain.
The outcome of the initial air quality assessment highlighted opportunities for reductions in emissions linked to on-site electricity generation and use of solid fuels, car use and move to electric fleet, as well as indicating opportunities in our value chain for the sourcing of plastic and glass products.
We are creating reduction plans around these key areas that are aligned to our pathway to zero and which aim to have a positive impact on air quality.
More about our action on climate to deliver the targets can be found in our pathway to net zero (PDF - 139KB).
Accelerating collective action on air pollution
We are members of the Alliance for Clean Air through the Clean Air Fund (CAF) and the World Economic Forum, which aims to drive corporate action on clean air to accelerate climate action and create healthy communities around the world.
The collective measurement of direct and value chain emissions across the Alliance for Clean Air membership aims to build a picture of the activities that give rise to poor air quality globally and intends to enable policy makers and industries to make informed decisions, considering the broader global impacts on health from poor air quality.

Responsible business is embedded in our strategy and supports our sustainable performance and long-term growth. It helps us build trust with and deliver returns to our stakeholders, reduce risk to our operations and deliver positive social impact.
We have six priority areas to build trust addressing what is most material to our business and the issues that matter the most to our stakeholders.

Our approach to responsible business
Our Responsible Business Performance Rating
Our Responsible Business Performance Rating measures the progress we are making on delivering against our Trust priority. The rating is one of our corporate KPIs and tracks progress against key metrics aligned to each of our six focus areas. In 2024, this included 22 metrics, which are summarised in our Responsible Business Performance Report.
The GSK Leadership Team (GLT) is accountable for delivering progress against the metrics and regularly reviews performance along with the Board’s Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC). Each individual metric is assessed as either: on track (metric met or exceeded); on track with work to do (at least 80% of metric has been achieved); or off track (metric missed by more than 20%).
In addition, in order to calculate the overall Responsible Business Performance rating, performance across all metrics is aggregated to a single score to illustrate whether we are on track, on track with work to do, or off track.
In 2024, 91% of our Responsible Business Performance Rating metrics were met or exceeded.

Governance
We are committed to operating at the highest standards of corporate governance. We believe our governance structure underpins our ability to deliver the Group's strategy to create long-term value and benefit for our shareholders and stakeholders.
Further information on how GSK is governed, including details on our Board and Management Committees, global compliance function and our codes and standards can be found in our company governance section.
Our corporate governance
Codes and standards
Risk management
Our risk management and internal control framework
Our risk management and internal control framework is well embedded and provides the ability for the Board to evaluate and oversee how the company manages principal and emerging risks in line with our strategy and long-term priorities. This framework is aligned to industry standards and legal and regulatory requirements. Our company-wide policy sets out the requirements, roles and responsibilities for the management and governance of risks, controls and supporting guidance on the essential elements of our internal control framework. Our Code sets out the overarching expectations for our employees and complementary workers. We aim to do the right thing with integrity and care as part of our culture. Our risk management and internal control framework incorporates our culture and our Speak Up processes, enabling us to identify and mitigate risks effectively. We monitor our most important risks and take action to address issues. We embed business continuity planning into our framework so we can continue operations in the event of a crisis. We routinely evaluate our framework for improvements.
Our Risk Management and Internal Control Policy can be found in Codes and standards.
Board oversight
The Board oversees our system of risk management and internal control and establishes our risk appetite, supported by the Audit & Risk Committee (ARC). The Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) and Science Committee further assess the effectiveness of risk management strategies pertinent to their defined remits. Further information on the Board, its committees’ and their responsibilities can be found in our company governance section.
Our corporate governance
Our Risk Oversight & Compliance Council (ROCC) supports the ARC and CRC to oversee the risks, and the strategies used to address them. Risk management and compliance boards across the Group promote the ‘tone from the top’, establish our risk culture and oversee the effectiveness of risk management activities, while also communicating information about internal controls.
Management is accountable for delivering on its objectives in line with its established risk appetite. The Disclosure Committee has the responsibility for considering the materiality of information and determining the disclosure of this information in a timely way. An Enterprise Risk Owner is responsible for each principal risk, with oversight by a GLT member. Risk owners report risk and mitigation to ROCC and the appropriate Board committee each quarter. Legal and Compliance support these efforts by advising on our business strategies, activities, risks and controls. Audit & Assurance provides assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of our framework.
Considering the likelihood, impact and timescale of risks
Our enterprise risk assessment methodology is the mechanism by which we assess all risk. Our risk assessment methodology considers the likelihood and impact of risks, and the timescale over which a risk could occur based on the most probable scenario and considering our existing internal controls. Our impact assessments include financial and nonfinancial considerations. We consider both current and emerging risks that could affect our ability to achieve our long-term priorities over the three-year horizon, in line with our viability statement. We also define risks in this way if we need to know more about how likely they are to materialise, or what impact they’d have if they did. We evaluate if additional investigation is required before classifying them as principal risks.
Risk management and compliance boards at all levels of the organisation identify emerging risks on an ongoing basis, and ROCC discusses emerging risks at each meeting. We also scan the risk horizon throughout the year to identify external trends that may be opportunities and/or emerging risks and monitor our business activities and internal environment for new, emerging and changing risks.
ROCC conducts an annual risk review to assess principal and emerging risks for the company. This review is supported by extensive analysis of external trends and insights, senior level interviews and recommendations from risk management and compliance boards and risk owners. ROCC shares this annual review with the ARC and Board for assessment and this forms the basis for the following year’s risk management focus.
2025 principal risks summary
We outline below the principal risks and uncertainties relevant to GSK’s business, financial condition and operations that may affect our performance and ability to achieve our objectives. These are the risks that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. These are not listed in order of significance. Operating in the pharmaceutical sector carries various inherent risks and uncertainties that may affect our business.

Press release on the transaction closure - 1 August 2019
We have made strong progress against our 3 long-term priorities – Innovation, Performance, Trust – over the last 18 months. We have improved our operating performance and have set out a new approach to R&D. We have also started to reshape the Group’s portfolio through prioritisation of R&D programmes, acquisitions such as that proposed with the oncology biopharmaceutical company, TESARO, the minority buy-out of the consumer healthcare business and a series of non-core product divestments. 
The combination brings together two highly complementary portfolios of trusted consumer health brands, including GSK’s Sensodyne, Voltaren and Panadol and Pfizer’s Advil, Centrum and Caltrate. The Joint Venture is a category leader in Pain Relief, Respiratory, Vitamin and Mineral Supplements, Digestive Health, OTC Skin Health and Therapeutic Oral Health. Through the combination of GSK and Pfizer’s consumer healthcare businesses we are creating substantial further value for shareholders. At the same time, incremental cashflows and visibility of the intended separation will help support GSK’s future capital planning and further investment in our pharmaceuticals pipeline.
  The transaction is transformational to the scale of our Consumer Healthcare business. Within three years of the closing of the transaction, we intend to separate the Joint Venture via a demerger. With our future intention to separate, the transaction also presents a clear pathway forward for us to create a new global Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company, with an R&D approach focused on science related to the immune system, use of genetics and advanced technologies, and a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare company.

Home Responsibility Environment Climate
Climate
We are committed to net zero impact on climate across our entire value chain. Here, we detail our climate targets and how we aim to achieve them.
Our climate targets Operational emissions Value chain emissions
Our climate targets
To deliver our goal to have a net zero impact on climate, we have set the following targets, measured against a 2020 baseline:
80% absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions1 from a 2020 baseline, across all scopes2 and investment in nature-based solutions for the remaining 20% of our footprint by 2030
100% imported renewable electricity by 2025 and 100% renewable electricity (imported and generated) by 2030 (Scope 2)
Net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain by 2045: 90% absolute reduction in emissions from a 2020 baseline, across all scopes and all residual emissions neutralised.
The Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) has approved GSK’s net zero target for 2045 in line with their Corporate Net-Zero Standard, the world’s only framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science.
  Notes: 
[1] Previously stated as net zero by 2030
[2] This is a new longer-term target, aligned to the SBTi Net-Zero Standard definition of net zero
OUR PATHWAY TO NET ZERO IMPACT ON CLIMATE
See the document below for more information on our projected pathway to net zero impact on climate, including our value chain carbon footprint, and our approach to carbon credits
Pathway to a net zero impact on climate
Operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2)
About 7% of our carbon footprint comes directly from our own operations. To reduce operational carbon emissions, we will continue to focus on key activities including investment in renewable electricity, electric vehicles and energy reductions.  
  Renewable electricity
We are members of RE100 and have committed to reach 100% of our imported electricity from renewable sources by 2025 and 100% of all electricity we generate and import from renewable sources by 2030. We will increase renewable electricity through on-site generation and off-site power purchase agreements and certificates. This will not only reduce carbon emissions but also contribute to improving air quality and therefore respiratory health.
We are also collaborating with industry partners to investigate new clean technologies to replace use of natural gas for energy and heat production. We already have a biogas facility operating which use waste products on our site to convert to heat sources. 

Electric vehicles
We are a member of EV100 and are committed to transition our fleet to low-carbon vehicles and to install charging infrastructure at 100 sites by 2030. Increasing the use of electric vehicles reduces tailpipe emissions, which not only reduces our carbon emissions but has a positive impact on human health through reducing air pollution.
Energy reduction and eco-design
We continue to accelerate our successful energy reduction programme. This includes doing on-site energy analysis to identify opportunities to drive efficiencies, save energy and reduce costs. 
We apply the principles of eco-design and green chemistry when producing our medicines. This is to help us reduce or eliminate hazardous chemicals from the drug development and discovery process, and produce our medicines as efficiently as possible.
We research ways to replace hazardous or unsustainable chemicals with lower-impact alternatives, both internally and across our network of academic collaborations in green and sustainable chemistry. We have also published a number of specialist guides that help our scientists to understand the environmental impact of different solvents and reagents (chemicals used to produce our medicines) - and to encourage the use of lower-impact alternatives.


Value chain emissions (Scope 3)
About 93% of our carbon footprint is beyond our own operations and instead comes from our suppliers and in the patient use of our products. With this in mind, we will work across our full value chain to reduce carbon emissions, including building on our structured engagement programme with suppliers.   

Patient use
Patient use contributes approximately 53% of our total climate impact. This is because the current gas used in our metered-dose inhalers (MDI) is a greenhouse gas. To continue to deliver for patients and aim to reduce carbon emissions, we are working on an R&D programme to redevelop and redesign one of our MDIs, containing a next generation propellant. We began phase III trials in 2024 and, if successful, it has the potential to reduce the carbon footprint from the inhaler by approximately 90%.
At the same time, we already have a range of low carbon dry powder inhalers where clinically appropriate for patients. Our latest generation of respiratory products are in a low carbon format, meaning they are without a propellant.
Suppliers
Our Sustainable Procurement Programme requires our suppliers to take action on carbon, power, heat, transport, water, waste and the sustainable, deforestation-free sourcing of materials. This includes a requirement to disclose emissions, set carbon reduction targets aligned with 1.5oC, and switch to renewable power and heat.
As part of this programme, we actively support our suppliers with education and the adoption of new environmental sustainability measures. We continue to build capability across our procurement function to integrate sustainability, including through tender questions, contractual provisions and performance metrics.
Supply chain emissions are a shared challenge across our industry sector and we are collaborating to find shared solutions. For example, we participate in the Manufacture 2030 initiative with our industry peers, which encourages our suppliers to measure, manage and reduce their emissions. With Manufacture 2030, we co-developed the Activate programme, along with four other founding companies, to help active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) suppliers gain access to green funding and practical support to accelerate decarbonisation initiatives.
We are also working with our peers through the Energize programme to encourage the use of renewable energy throughout the pharmaceutical sector’s supply chain.
Launched by My Green Lab, we are a founding sponsor of Converge, a collaborative supply chain initiative to encourage suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of labs in their value chain.
We are also part of the Sustainable Markets Initiative Health Systems Task Force, made of up CEOs from seven global healthcare companies. The Task Force has announced joint action on near-term emissions reduction targets and accelerating the delivery of net zero healthcare systems by addressing emissions across supply chains, patient care pathways and clinical trials.
Logistics
Logistics accounts for 3% of our indirect emissions. We are continuing to transition from transporting our products from airfreight to sea freight wherever possible. This means both lower distribution costs and a smaller footprint.  

Carbon credits
Whilst we are focused on emissions reductions to meet our carbon targets, at the same time, we are investing in high quality nature protection and restoration projects that support our net-zero and nature positive goals, and deliver co-benefits to human health.
We plan to secure carbon credits for the 20% emissions we estimate to have as residual in 2030, and for a maximum of 10% residual emissions by 2045.
We understand the scepticism around the quality of some of the existing carbon credits in the Voluntary Carbon Market (VCM). That’s why we aim to ensure our credits are of the highest quality. We partner with expert developers and NGOs to invest in early-stage projects for the long term and ensure the design is inclusive of nature and health co-benefits.
For more information on our approach to offsets, see our pathway to net zero impact on climate (PDF 139KB).

Use of animals
We take our moral and societal responsibility to animals seriously by providing high standards for the care, welfare and treatment of all animals in our charge.
Our company-wide policy The 3Rs at GSK FAQs about animal studies
Our company-wide policy
We use animals for research studies when their physiology and disease process is similar to that in humans. When using animals, we follow scientific principles to ensure that we prevent or minimise pain and distress before, during, and after experimental procedures.     
Our company-wide policy covers the standards of care and the ethical treatment of animals in research, development and testing of all GSK medicines and vaccines. All GSK animal research must comply with this policy.
We actively observe our policy by:   
Investing in the development and validation of replacement technologies, including complex in vitro models and in silico models.  
Applying appropriate statistics in study designs to answer the scientific question using as few animals as possible.  
Engaging experts and specialists in humane care to minimise any pain or distress to animals, and actively pursue initiatives to improve animal welfare based on current animal welfare science.  
Employing trained specialty staff, including qualified veterinarians, available at all times for advice and help with clinical care.

The 3Rs at GSK
Our 3Rs[1] strategy of replacement, reduction and refinement is a science-led, ethical framework that we use to guide us in our work with animals. Where animal research is conducted or commissioned, we are advancing the 3Rs (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement) and seeking ways to minimise animal use and reduce the impact on the animals.
Replacement
Replacement
Accelerating the development and use of models and tools, based on the latest science and technologies, to address important scientific questions without the use of animals.
Reduction
Reduction
Appropriately designed and analysed animal experiments that are robust and reproducible, and truly add to the knowledge base.
Refinement
Refinement
Advancing animal welfare by exploiting the latest in vivo technologies, and by improving understanding of the impact of welfare on scientific outcomes.
Across GSK, where animal research is conducted or commissioned, we are advancing the 3Rs and seeking ways to minimise animal use and reduce the impact on the animals. Wherever possible, we pursue new methods and technologies that do not require animals such as in vitro models and in silico prediction. 
When we do use animals, the best experimental design is achieved through application of statistical principles to ensure the minimum numbers of animals are used to answer scientific questions. Peer review occurs from additional scientists, biostatisticians, animal welfare specialists and veterinarians. 
We are continuously improving animal welfare through shared learnings, housing and husbandry refinements and technologies. All our proposed animal research is reviewed by ethical panels. These panels consider animal welfare and the 3Rs prior to the approval of our studies.
  [1]The 3Rs principles were developed in 1959 with the standard definitions recently expanded by the NC3Rs.
At GSK our animal welfare strategy is anchored in enabling innovative science and technology through our commitments to the contemporary principles of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement, also known as the 3Rs.

Fraudulent internet recruitment activities
Warning against fraudulent internet recruitment activities
Our attention has been drawn to the fraudulent activities of persons posing as recruitment agencies or GSK employees. The fraud involves sending people a request for personal information, making job offers and/or extorting fees for recruitment-related accommodation or preparation sessions ahead of an interview or assessment centre. 
We would like to make it clear that GSK never requires candidates to make payment during a recruitment process. If you receive a genuine job offer from us, whether the offer is made directly by GSK or through an agency, you will not be required to pay any money towards administration fees. We also recommend that you do not disclose personal or financial details to anyone you do not know.  
  Spot the signs of a fraudulent communication 
Recruiters for GSK will never ask for any form of payment or banking information. They may ask for the following during a formal interview process or post acceptance of an offer: 
Passport information
Personal identification such as your National Insurance number, Social Security number etc.
In addition, you should consider the following to determine the validity of a communication: 
Are there major spelling or grammatical errors in the communication?
What is the sender’s email address? Does this seem consistent with previous communications? The GSK email format is ‘name.initial.surname@gsk.com’. If you are contacted through a LinkedIn in-mail, please ensure that you review the full profile of the recruiter sending the message to check the legitimacy of the profile
We may use third parties to support recruitment activities. You should search the name of the company on the internet if you receive a communication from a non-GSK email address to check their validity
Who is sending the email? If the email purports to be from a senior executive at the company, you should report this using the contact details below
Are you being offered a role without having a formal interview? This indicates a fraudulent communication 
Reporting potentially fraudulent emails
If you are unsure of the legitimacy of a communication you have received, please contact: uk.corporate-security@gsk.com. 
Please provide as much information as possible about the role you have applied for as well as the communication you have received.

We want to make sure our social media channels are a safe and enjoyable environment where people can comment, question and engage with our content and each other. 
We also have a responsibility to manage these channels in line with the regulatory environment in which we operate. As a result, we may remove posts, graphics, comments, videos, photos, or any other content that: 
Is potentially libellous, defamatory or disparaging
Violates another’s copyright or intellectual property
Condones or promotes illegal activity
Is misleading, fraudulent or deceptive
Uses language that is vulgar, discriminatory or harassing
Is spam or intended to cause technical disruptions to the channels

Suspected adverse events
Patient safety is of utmost importance to us and we take all information related to our medicines seriously. We have a legal and ethical duty to follow up any reports of adverse events associated with our medicines or vaccines, which in turn assists us with the monitoring of their safety profiles. If you believe you have experienced an adverse event when using one of our products, please contact us to report a possible side effect.

Home Media Our response to the situation in Ukraine
Our response to the situation in Ukraine
Alongside the global community, we share deep concern about the tragic events happening in Ukraine. We are taking actions guided by our purpose, and as a company dedicated to health and care for people and patients.
Our first priority is the safety, security and wellbeing of GSK people, wherever they are located. After this, our focus is to make sure our products reach the people who need them, including supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and surrounding countries.
We condemn the fighting and the harm and suffering it’s causing to people in Ukraine and beyond. The actions taking place are in violent contradiction to our purpose, and unshakeable belief that all people should be treated with dignity, respect and humanity.
GSK in Ukraine
We employ 160 people and we’re doing everything we can to help them stay safe in very difficult conditions.
How we’re helping through humanitarian aid
We want to make sure our products reach the people who need them and support humanitarian efforts in Ukraine where we can:
GSK people around the world have donated over £326,307 to Save the Children and the Red Cross, an amount GSK has matched.
GSK is providing targeted humanitarian support through long-term NGO partners who have teams on the ground in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. We’ll continue to respond as the situation evolves, guided by our humanitarian principles.
We’ve donated £3.25 million to the Red Cross and Save the Children who are providing food, water, first aid, medicines, warm clothes and shelter for people in Ukraine and refugees at the border.
We’ve also donated £1 million to Crown Agents (an NGO that has worked with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health for the past 20 years) to fund medical trauma kits. And we’re having urgent discussions with them on how we can continue to supply essential medicines into Ukraine
We’ve donated £2 million via the Global Fund to help  maintain HIV and TB treatment, diagnostics, and Opioid substitution therapy for internally displaced persons and hard to reach communities, who are vulnerable to treatment interruption.
Through ViiV Healthcare, we have donated more than 10,000 packs of anti-retroviral medicines to national HIV/AIDS programmes and NGO partners across 4 countries, to support people living with HIV in the region who have been impacted by the conflict. This includes a significant donation of paediatric Tivicay for children living with HIV in Ukraine, as well as donations to support continued access to HIV treatment for displaced people in neighbouring countries.
ViiV Healthcare is also providing funding of more than £850,000 from Positive Action to 12 community-based organisations, supporting humanitarian response activities both within Ukraine and surrounding countries.
We have donated over 600,000 units of medicine and consumer products, including antibiotics, asthma medicine, treatments for epilepsy patients and pain relief products, to the Ukrainian Ministry of Health and other local partners, either directly or through Direct Relief, our long term humanitarian product donation partner.
Our GSK teams in neighbouring countries have contributed an additional 23,000 packs of healthcare products and £100,000 in donations to local charities.
GSK in Russia
The situation in Russia is complex and rapidly changing, and we continue to keep our approach under review.
Our priorities are to support GSK people and access to medicines and vaccines.
We support global sanctions and comply with them fully. We have taken a precautionary approach to stop, to the fullest extent possible, any direct involvement and support to the Russian government and military.
In line with our purpose to support people’s health, regardless of race, sex, nationality, ethnicity, language or religion, we believe everyone has the right to access healthcare and, as an innovator and supplier of needed medicines and vaccines, we have a responsibility to make them available while we can.
We continue to supply medicines and vaccines to Russia. Where we experience challenges delivering them, we will prioritise supply of products that are essential for people’s health (always in compliance with sanctions). This prioritisation will take into account medical criticality, patient need and availability of alternatives.
We have stopped promotional activities in Russia and will use profits made from our operations in Russia to support global humanitarian and health security initiatives, and to fund global access programmes for medicines and vaccines. 
We will not start any new clinical trials and are not enrolling new patients into existing clinical trials.

Our UK charitable investments
We support a number of national and local community projects through the GSK IMPACT Awards and our UK charity investments.
GSK IMPACT Awards
The UK GSK IMPACT Awards, established in 1997, is an annual programme that recognises and rewards charities doing outstanding work to improve people's health and wellbeing throughout the UK. The awards are run in partnership with The King’s Fund, a leading independent health charity, and are open to charities with an annual income of between £150,000 to £3 million that are at least three years old.
The name ‘IMPACT’ is derived from the following criteria: Innovation, Management, Partnership, Achievement, Community focus and Targeting need - all of which applicants must be able to clearly demonstrate.

GSK IMPACT Award winners
However, becoming a GSK IMPACT Award winner means so much more than just receiving the unrestricted donation. As part of the award, all winners are invited to participate in a three-day training and development programme with The King’s Fund (valued at an additional £13,500). In addition, all award winners are also encouraged to join the GSK IMPACT Awards Network, providing ongoing support and connecting past winners together. This is designed to encourage members to work with each other, grow together, and share best practices both online and at face-to-face meetings to promote their continued success and growth.
Award winners receive unrestricted funding of £40,000 together with promotional assets to tell their organisation’s story. Runners-up receive unrestricted funding of £4,000.

While climate change must be tackled at a global level, water challenges are much more localised. By better understanding our water use across the GSK value chain, we can focus our efforts in the areas where we can make the biggest difference.
The world is expected to face a 40% shortfall in fresh water supply within 10 years1, exacerbating the current water crisis that many are already facing globally. In relation to healthcare, fresh water is critical to achieving universal health coverage, and for GSK, ready access to a fresh water supply enables us to produce vaccines and medicines and safeguard livelihoods.

Our water targets
We have set out the following targets:
Achieve good water stewardship at 100% of our sites by 2025
Achieve zero impact active API levels1 for all sites and key suppliers by 2030
Be water neutral in our own operations and at key suppliers in water-stressed regions by 2030
How we plan to achieve our water targets

Understanding our value chain water footprint
We have mapped our water footprint by establishing the volume of water we use throughout our value chain and where it is being used around the world. Our measure of whether an area is water-stressed considers the quantity, quality, WASH risk (access to water, sanitation and hygiene) and regulatory and reputational risks across our value chain.

Water stewardship and water use
In 2024, 100% of our sites continued to achieve good water stewardship status, in line with the Alliance for Water Stewardship’s definition. This involves reducing the amount of water we use, improving water quality through minimising discharges and working with community and public sector stakeholders to address local water challenges. These plans are developed to reflect the local water basin challenges.
At all GSK sites and key suppliers-located in water stressed regions, we are committed to water neutrality by 2030. We used water risk data from the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) to understand which of our sites are located in water-stressed basins, and therefore face increasing water availability, quality and access risks.
We define water neutrality at these sites using three criteria: achieving the Alliance for Water Stewardship Standard certification, reducing water use by 20% and by replenishing water quantity in the basin equivalent to the site’s 2030 footprint. Where possible, we address shared water challenges in the basin through collective action, including access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation (WASH) services. Our approach extends to key suppliers co-located in these water-stressed regions.
We have identified several initial water basins in water-stressed regions where we have manufacturing sites, including in Algeria, India and Pakistan, which we will prioritise for investment in water neutrality in a way that is responsive to the local challenges.  
For example, we have partnered with a local NGO, Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR), in Nashik, India on a water replenishment project designed to improve ecosystem conditions, enhance the climate resilience of local agriculture, and help local villages manage water resources to improve their health and livelihoods.
We are also a founding partner of the Women + Water Collaborative in India, which launched in October 2023, working with the Water Resilience Coalition, an initiative between the UN – Global Compact and the Pacific Institute. This programme brings together companies from different sectors to leverage women’s leadership to improve access to clean water and sanitation, ultimately supporting the health of local communities.

Supplier engagement
Our supply chain accounts for 95% of our water footprint2. It’s therefore important that we also engage our suppliers on efficient water usage, particularly those based in high water-stressed areas where we are aiming for water neutrality at our sites and key suppliers. We are developing a programme to partner with our suppliers, to better understand their water impact and identify ways of working together to achieve our water goals. 
Collaboration 
We realise that collaboration is key to expanding the scale and scope of our water efforts to address the magnitude of the global water crisis. We have been members of the UN CEO Water Mandate since 2009. The Mandate is a commitment platform for business leaders and learners to advance water stewardship.
Endorsing companies commit to action across six key elements and report annually on progress. In implementing water stewardship, endorsing companies also identify and reduce critical water risks to their businesses, seize water-related opportunities, and contribute to water security and the Sustainable Development Goals. As a member of the WRC we have pledged to achieve the following through individual and collective action by 2050:
Net positive water impact - Achieve a measurable and net positive impact in water-stressed basins on availability, quality and accessibility through industry-leading water operations and basin initiatives
Water-resilient value chain - Develop, implement and enable strategies to support leading impact-based water resilience practices across the global value chain
Global leadership - Raise the global ambition of water resilience through public and corporate outreach
GSK is the Basin Champion for the Godavari basin in India, a water-stressed region where many of our key suppliers are located. This includes those involved in the water-intensive production of active pharmaceutical ingredients that are critical for our medicines and vaccines. In this role, we’re committed to working with our partners and local communities on programme to reduce water usage and enhance water security.
  Pharmaceuticals in the environment
We’re committed to keeping any Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) emissions from manufacturing – including those that might contribute to antimicrobial resistance – below the predicted no-effect level for all sites and key suppliers. This means ensuring any API emissions from manufacturing are kept below levels that negatively impact human health or the environment. We carry out environmental testing on all of our pharmaceutical products and use this data to set safe discharge targets for our manufacturing supply chain. For antibiotic emissions, these safe discharge targets are industry standards agreed through the AMR Industry Alliance.
We are a partner in the Innovative Medicines Initiative project which is a leading collaboration across industry, academia, governments and others focused on the Prioritisation and Risk Evaluation of Medicines in the Environment (PREMIER). This programme is addressing the science and data gap behind safe levels of environmental risk for APIs, making environmental data on APIs more accessible and supported with credible science. The project is also supporting greener design of pharmaceuticals. 
We lead the AMR benchmark, which includes recognition of our environmental risk-management approach.

Advanced technology is increasing the chances of improving outcomes for cancer patients
Blood cancers
Myelofibrosis is a rare blood cancer where excessive scar tissue builds up in the bone marrow, which interferes with the production of healthy blood cells. Nearly all myelofibrosis patients will eventually develop anaemia and require regular blood transfusions. 
Myelofibrosis affects around 25,000 patients in the US, most of whom either have anaemia when they’re diagnosed or develop it eventually. Patients often need transfusions, and around 30% stop treatment with established therapies because of anaemia. Myelofibrosis patients who are anaemic and dependent on transfusions have poor prognosis and shortened survival rates. We are utilising our expertise in haematology and advanced technologies to address the unmet needs of patients with myelofibrosis, improving their outcomes and quality of life.
Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer globally and is generally considered treatable but not curable. There are around 180,000 cases of multiple myeloma diagnosed every year. 
There are limited treatment options for patients with multiple myeloma when they relapse or stop responding to previous therapies. Therefore, our goal is to offer more options for patients across all lines of therapy. We are exploring how potential combination therapies can further improve outcomes for patients with multiple myeloma.

Gynaecologic cancers
We are working towards breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases such as endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer.
Endometrial, or uterine, cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women worldwide, and incidence rates are expected to rise by almost 40% between 2020 and 2040. Our research focuses on developing innovative treatment options that target specific biomarkers associated with endometrial cancer. By understanding the genetic makeup of tumours, we can identify potential vulnerabilities and develop therapies that specifically address the underlying mechanisms of the disease.
Ovarian cancer is the eighth most common cancer worldwide. Globally, more than 200,000 women die with the disease every year (GLOBOCAN 2022). Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a later stage, which leads to high occurrence rates and poorer outcomes. We are researching how certain therapeutics combinations can help to optimise treatment outcomes for those newly diagnosed or living with advanced ovarian cancer.
Continuing advances in immuno-oncology 
Immuno-oncology is a field of medicine that harnesses the power of the immune system to fight against cancer. This class of therapies has significantly improved outcomes for patients with many types of cancer, however, the search for new immuno-oncology treatments and combinations is important.
We are actively exploring the potential of investigational medicines in our pipeline to help the immune system recognise and kill cancer cells more effectively. We are conducting research to identify the right biomarkers and subpopulations that will enhance patient outcomes through combination therapies. We are also investigating the potential of precision medicine-based technology to match the right medicine to the right patient, further improving patient outcomes and quality of life.

Leading through action
  Ambitious for patients: representative clinical studies
Diseases and medicines can affect people differently depending on their ethnicity, sex, race and age so we need to make sure that our clinical trials include those affected by the disease under study. This supports our business performance by providing healthcare providers and the individuals who are prescribed our medicines and vaccines confidence in the safety and effectiveness of our products. Since 2022, all our phase III clinical trials have representation plans in place before commencing enrolment to reflect the people most impacted by a particular disease.
Now, our focus is on actual enrolment of participants impacted by the disease under study. 88% of phase III trials completing enrolment in 2024 met our enrolment thresholds needed so that trial participants represent the disease epidemiology under study.

Home Innovation Trials Data transparency
Data transparency
We have a long-standing commitment to clinical data transparency. Here we give an insight into initiatives to increase access to our clinical research.
Our commitment
Our commitment to the transparency of clinical trial data reflects our wish to help advance scientific understanding and enable the scientific community to learn from the research we have undertaken. It also allows us to acknowledge the great contribution made by the people who take part in our clinical research.
The GSK Study Register
The GSK Study Register is an online portal where anyone can access information about the clinical research we carry out on our existing vaccines and medicines. We were the first pharmaceutical company to make this information available online.
As part of our commitment to transparency, we share information on GSK sponsored studies (product clinical trials and non-interventional human studies of the clinical efficiency, safety, or effectiveness of our products). This includes phase I-IV clinical trials and observational studies of both investigational and marketed products. We register the protocol summaries before we start the trial and we post the results summaries within a year of study completion. Our study results are made public regardless of whether they reflect positively or negatively on our vaccines and medicines. The GSK Study Register now includes over 6,000 summaries of our clinical studies.
Since the beginning of 2020 we have initiated development of plain language summaries of our clinical trial results. These are summaries of clinical trial results written in simple language, understandable to a layperson. We develop these summaries for our phase II-IV trials and share them with the study investigator for distribution to trial participants, in addition to posting them on the GSK Study Register and on Trial Results Summaries.
In addition to our study register and others such as ClinicalTrials.gov , we also seek to publish our clinical research results in peer-reviewed scientific journals. To support our commitment to data transparency, authors are strongly encouraged to submit to open access journals or select open access options where available in standard journals
  Publishing our clinical study reports
In February 2013, we announced our support for the AllTrials campaign, which calls for the registration of clinical trials and the disclosure of trial results and clinical study reports (CSRs). CSRs are the formal study reports that we prepare, to provide more detail on the design, methods and results of our clinical trials. They form the basis of the information we provide to regulators when a vaccine or medicine is submitted to them for approval.
Since then, we have published over 2,700 CSRs for our approved vaccines and medicines, dating back to the formation of GSK in 2000.
More recently, the European (2015) and Canadian medicine regulators (2019) implemented policies to disclose CSRs and matched the commitment GSK had made voluntarily since 2013. With Clinical Study Reports now available via many regulated processes, in 2022 we moved to post the CSR synopsis on our Study Register and focus our efforts on improving transparency in other areas.
Patient-level data
We recognise that there is a highly detailed level of data sitting behind the results of our clinical trials that scientific researchers may find useful. This is known as patient-level data.
Researchers can request access to our studies by providing a scientific research proposal with a commitment to publish their findings.  Additional details on the process are available on the GSK Study Register.

Engaging with healthcare professionals
GSK is committed to disclosing the payments we make, as we work together with healthcare professionals.
    Global speaker programmes Collaborating on clinical trials and research Disclosures
Global speaker programmes
For patients to benefit from new medical innovations, HCPs need to access and understand the latest available data and clinical use of the product.
Feedback from HCPs shows that they prefer to learn about new data and clinical experience through peer-to-peer programmes with global expert practitioners who have direct experience with our medicines. 
To help HCPs share new data on our products and understand their clinical use, in some cases we:
make fair market value payments to global expert practitioners who speak about the new science behind selected GSK products, their associated diseases and clinical practice in promotional settings
pay reasonable travel costs (except in the US) for an HCP to attend a GSK-organised standalone meeting to learn about data and clinical expertise.
directly pay registration fees for HCPs to attend remote congress webinars/webcasts. We do not sponsor HCPs to attend local and international conferences.
This policy is limited to select products in certain countries around the world and controls and training are in place, including measures to track appropriate payment and use of external speakers.
Where legally permitted, we will report individual-level payments made each year to HCPs for attending educational meetings and for the provision of services, such as speaking at events or attending advisory boards. Where individual level disclosure is not legally permitted, we will continue to report aggregate payments. 
Collaborating on clinical trials and research 
Healthcare professionals (HCPs) help us identify potential volunteers for clinical trials, administer the investigational medicine or vaccine to patients, and monitor the results.
All HCPs who work with us on clinical trials have contracts and are paid for their work on these clinical trials. This payment covers their time, plus the cost of investigations they may need to carry out regarding the suitability of a patient and the effectiveness of the treatment.
We have a commitment to publicly disclose the research payments that are made to healthcare professionals and to their institutions for conducting clinical research.
Disclosure reports
Outside of Europe and the US, we continue to support transparency as industry associations or governments establish specific guidelines for disclosure. Where legally permitted, we disclose annually individual level payments for attending educational meetings and for the provision of services, such as speaking at events or attending advisory boards in the markets where these activities take place. Where individual level disclosure is not legally permitted, we will continue to report aggregate payments.

In the US, we report our payments and other transfers of value to US Healthcare Professionals and US Healthcare Organisations we have worked with, in compliance with federal and state transparency laws.  View the Federal CMS Open Payments data

In Europe, we fully support and continue to implement the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) Code on the disclosure of individual transfer of value from pharmaceutical companies to HCPs and HCOs. To affirm our commitment to the principles of the EFPIA Code of Practice we've signed this self-certification letter (PDF - 197KB).

Some of our recent collaborations
By working with partners, we can achieve more and ensure faster innovation to address disease areas of high unmet need for as many people as possible. Our collaborations with our partners underscore our commitment to finding novel treatments to improve the quality of life of patients suffering from underserved diseases. 
Oxford
Oxford
The University of Oxford, a world renowned research institution, and GSK have launched an immuno-prevention programme to advance novel cancer research. This research could then be used to inform future development of vaccines to prevent cancer.
The collaboration will enhance the already established research agreement between Oxford and GSK, which includes the existing five-year collaboration to establish the Oxford-GSK Institute of Molecular and Computational Medicine.
Muna
Muna
Muna Therapeutics is a biotechnology company focused on developing innovative therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.
The GSK and Muna research collaboration will leverage Muna’s MiND-MAP platform to identify and validate new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease, potentially leading to new treatments for patients dealing with significant unmet need.
Relation
Relation
Relation is a leader in integrating wet lab experimentation, computation, and machine learning to enhance drug discovery.
GSK's collaboration with Relation and their patient-centric discovery platform presents a unique opportunity to accelerate the development of new medicines. Relation will conduct observational studies to create two distinct sets of functional disease data, which will then be analysed using Relation's Lab-in-the-Loop platform.  The collaboration will focus on the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets for fibrotic diseases and osteoarthritis.

We are world leaders in next-generation HIV treatment and prevention, through ViiV Healthcare which we majority own. We have an industry-leading pipeline, driven by patient insights.
World leaders in next-generation HIV treatment
1:00
View video on YouTube
HIV remains one of the world’s biggest health epidemics, with 1.3 million new diagnoses annually, and more than 39 million people living with HIV. There is not yet a cure for HIV; however, 40 years of innovation has transformed HIV into a manageable, chronic health condition, enabling people living with HIV to lead long and healthy lives. Despite this progress, HIV stigma is still pervasive and impacts people living with HIV and their care.
The fear of the harsh judgement and discrimination associated with HIV can prevent many people from getting tested and diagnosed, as well as starting and staying on treatment. We are committed to changing that. Our goal is to minimise the impact of HIV on people’s lives by treating and preventing the disease and tackling HIV-related stigma. We are steadfast in our pursuit of a cure. Our research is driven by patient insights, patient demand and unmet need and we are working to transform the experience of people living with HIV.
Through ViiV Healthcare (majority owned by GSK), the world's only company 100% focused on HIV, we have been at the forefront of shifting the treatment paradigm for HIV. We have focused on developing innovative regimens that offer potent and well-tolerated options for patients. We’re focusing research on novel treatment options that allow people living with HIV to take fewer drugs or take them much less often, and we are exploring new types of long-acting therapy to give people living with HIV the option to self-administer their medicine at home, as well as treatments to prevent HIV.
What inspires us to be innovators and disruptors? It’s the 39 million people living with HIV around the world. Our mission is to leave no person living with HIV behind and that’s why we won't stop innovating.

CEO, ViiV Healthcare

BEHIND THE SCIENCE MAGAZINE
‘This could be a golden moment’: Is prevention the ‘medicine’ we need to end the HIV epidemic?
Our HIV partnerships
Our commitment to research and development drives us to continuously explore new avenues for HIV treatment and prevention. By leveraging our expertise and collaborative partnerships, we aim to address unmet needs and improve outcomes for individuals living with HIV. Through our unwavering dedication to the HIV community, we are working towards a future where HIV is no longer a barrier to living a fulfilling and healthy life.
We have an exclusive licensing agreement with Shionogi for an innovative treatment. We continue to progress our unique industry/academic partnership with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill through our jointly-owned QURA Therapeutics.
Through ViiV we have partnerships with grassroots community organisations who are leading the HIV response globally and often in challenging environments where discrimination and stigma remain highly pervasive. 
We collaborate with organisations like the International Aids Society,  Clinton Health Access Initiative and the Medicines Patent Pool to maximise the global impact of our medicines. Through voluntary license agreements, we enable generic manufacturers to create paediatric versions of our medicines, where 99% of children with HIV live. We are dedicated to strengthening our partnerships and expanding access initiatives to ensure that our medicines reach those who need them most.

Home Investors Shareholder information Share scam alert
Share scam alert
In recent years, many companies have become aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters.

These are typically from overseas-based ‘brokers’, working for firms that have become known as ‘boiler rooms’, who target shareholders, offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or high risk shares, or by offering investment opportunities to purchase newly-issued guaranteed income bonds. GSK has also recently seen an increased volume of scam calls to its shareholders involving offers to purchase GSK shares at a premium price, as part of a supposed takeover scheme.
These ‘brokers’ can be very persistent and extremely persuasive, and often offer very attractive returns. It is not just novice investors who have been duped in this way. Many victims have been successfully investing for several years. Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or bonds with a guaranteed income, offers to sell their GSK shares at a premium price, or offers of free company reports.

If you receive any unsolicited investment advice, we recommend that you:
Make sure you get the name of the person and organisation
Check that the firm is properly authorised before getting involved by visiting the FCA register of authorised firms
Do not give out any personal information until you are certain the scheme is legitimate
If you have any concerns, report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 or by using this online form

The FCA publishes a list of these unauthorised firms on its website. If one of these firms contacts you by phone, the best course of action is to hang up. If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme or have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service. If you have already paid money to share fraudsters you should contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.
GSK is aware that shareholders have received, and continue to receive, unsolicited communications from various third parties prompting shareholders to buy or sell their GSK securities, or inviting them to invest in bond issuances.

We strongly recommend that all calls and emails received from third parties persuading shareholders to deal in GSK securities or partake in bond investing be ignored as they may be scams. We encourage all shareholders to be cautious and report any suspicious activity to the FCA using the contact details provided above.

You should never give out your personal details or click on a link in an unsolicited email as it could compromise your personal or internet security. If in doubt, please contact GSK directly.
Details of any share dealing facilities that GSK endorses will be included in company mailings.
For more information on investment scams, please visit the FCA website.

Home Innovation Tech
Tech
We harness the power of advanced tech to bring innovative medicines and vaccines to patients better and faster. Tech is revolutionising how we develop vaccines and medicines, streamline clinical trials, optimise supply chains, and enhance patient care.
Getting ahead with tech
We’re at a transformational moment in health. With advances in science and tech, we can prevent and change the course of disease better and faster than ever before to impact the health of millions.
  Shobie Ramakrishnan
Chief Digital and Technology Officer
Accelerating pipeline innovation
We are working to revolutionise healthcare, using cutting-edge data and platform technologies. We apply our expertise in data and analytical tools as well as platform technologies to advance and accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of innovative medicines and vaccines for people worldwide.
Data tech helps us to gain a deep understanding of the patient, human biology, and disease mechanisms. Through the use of genetic data, AI and machine learning, we can unravel the mysteries of disease to design our vaccines and medicines to optimise clinical effect. We do this by matching genetic targets with the most effective tech platform such as oligonucleotides, mRNA, small molecules and monoclonal antibodies. This means we can tackle more challenging diseases that were once considered too difficult to target.
Target choice
Target choice
We prioritise genetic targets most likely to deliver significant health impact and prevent or change the course of disease. We can then develop treatments to address the underlying causes of the disease and prevent the disease from progressing.
For example, through analysis of genetic data we've found a connection between a protein involved in the immune system and a health condition. We are using this knowledge to develop potential treatments that may be able to provide relief to patients.
Patient identification
Patient identification
We use data and technology to understand which patients are likely to respond well to a treatment and benefit most at specific stages of the disease. This helps us to personalise treatments and improve outcomes for patients so they receive the most effective care, at the right time.
We are using this approach to help explore treatments in more patients with a range of conditions. By modelling retrospective data using AI/ML, we can see how different patients might respond.
Molecule design
Molecule design
Using platform tech like oligonucleotides, mRNA, small molecules and monoclonal antibodies, we design medicines and vaccines at the molecular level to target specific parts of a disease and ensure it can be manufactured consistently and as safely as possible.
For example, we are exploring how to use oligonucleotides to target specific proteins associated with liver disease.

BEHIND THE SCIENCE
Using AI, machine learning and data to unlock the mysteries of disease
AI ML data computing power
Driving performance to reach patients better and faster
Our depth and breadth of data and integrated use of tech across every part of our business is accelerating our performance and improving how we help patients. From AI and robotics to data tech, we're transforming our supply chain, empowering our people with data tech and supporting the entire patient journey.
Smart manufacturing
Smart manufacturing
We are revolutionising our supply chain utilising data, AI, machine learning, robotics, and automation to boost efficiency, product quality and capacity. For instance, we’re using digital twin models (“digital factories”) across several products to simulate processes, anticipate issues and accelerate manufacturing. By optimising our supply chain, we can ensure a steady supply of medicines and vaccines to patients worldwide.
Cultivating a tech-enabled culture
Cultivating a tech-enabled culture
We empower our people to find solutions by cultivating a tech-enabled culture. We also automate and scale processes and tasks where tech can provide faster and more precise solutions. This frees up our talented workforce to focus on what they do best - solving complex problems using creativity, human judgement, and deep expertise.
Supporting the patient journey
Supporting the patient journey
Using data and technology, we aim to support the entire patient journey, from before patients are prescribed our vaccines and medicines to ongoing care management. One such example is our digital tool EasyVax, the first-ever vaccines scheduler in the US for all recommended adult immunisations (regardless of manufacturer) to improve vaccination rates and reduce preventable diseases. Using a QR code patients can schedule their vaccination appointment at a local pharmacy, from their smart phones. By providing opportunities for personalised care and effectively managing their health conditions patients can have more control of their health and well-being.

A trusted and capable partner
We believe the bigger the challenge, the bigger the need for collaboration. That’s why we collaborate with a wide range of stakeholders, including governments, policymakers, academia, and the tech and biotech industries. By partnering with experts in science and technology, we ensure that we have access to the best knowledge and resources to drive innovation and make a positive impact on global health.
As a trusted partner, we uphold the highest ethical standards in our use of data technology. Together, we work to unlock the full potential of data technology in discovering, developing, and providing access to medicines and vaccines globally.
Through partnerships with the UK Biobank and FinnGen, we have access to extensive datasets, allowing us to enhance drug discovery through the application of AI/ML tools. Additionally, we are working with Tempus and King's College London to ensure that patients are matched with personalised treatment at the most appropriate stage of their disease.

Respiratory, immunology and inflammation
We are pushing the frontiers of respiratory science and harnessing the science of the immune system to transform patient outcomes in areas of unmet need, based on decades of innovative research.
IL-5 mediated conditions Asthma and COPD Lupus Refractory chronic cough Low-carbon inhalers
Advancing respiratory and immunology medicine
1:00
View video on YouTube
For over five decades, we have been at the forefront of the most complex respiratory health challenges. We have a deep understanding of the underlying drivers of disease in different groups of patients with conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our ambition is to redefine the future of respiratory medicine with a broad portfolio of next-generation treatments that work in distinct ways to help as many patients as possible. We continue to pursue the most ambitious treatment goals, aiming for early interventions that prevent, treat and stop disease, limiting future complications for patients.
Our deep understanding of the immune system is also leading to advances in our growing immunology pipeline. Here, we’re building on our decades of knowledge in inflammatory mechanisms to target fibrotic lung, liver and kidney disease.
IL-5 mediated conditions and type 2 inflammation
For more than 25 years we have been combining our deep understanding of respiratory disease with our work in immunology. IL-5 mediated conditions encompass a range of diseases for which there have been few, if any, effective treatments. Our leading research into conditions of type 2 inflammation mediated through the messenger molecule (cytokine) IL-5 has, and continues to, advance thinking about the most effective treatments for respiratory conditions like severe asthma, COPD and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps.
Our research aims to redefine treatment goals across these conditions going beyond optimal management of daily symptoms to modify the course of disease. This could slow or prevent disease progression, reduce the risk of organ damage and in some conditions help more people achieve the ambitious treatment goal of clinical remission.
Asthma and COPD
With an industry-leading portfolio of inhaled medicines and targeted biologics and vaccines we are focused on improving outcomes and the lives of millions of people living with respiratory diseases like asthma and COPD. We are working to keep people safe from infections and prevent diseases from getting worse. We also focus on providing relief for symptoms to help improve people's well-being and live a full life.
We continue to build on decades of pioneering work to deliver more ambitious treatment goals for people with respiratory diseases, working with patients and medical experts to develop the next generation standard of care and redefine the future of respiratory medicine.
  Remission could be possible for people with severe asthma, giving them a new outlook on life
BEHIND THE SCIENCE MAGAZINE
Remission could be possible for people with asthma, giving them a new outlook on life
Lupus
For more than 10 years, we have been advancing the scientific understanding and management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) a chronic autoimmune disease, as well as lupus nephritis, the kidney inflammation caused by lupus. Through the wealth of evidence we have generated, we are helping to prevent avoidable organ damage, modify the course of disease and improve long-term outcomes for those affected by lupus. 
Our work extends beyond lupus. We are exploring how targeted inhibition could improve outcomes and address the unmet needs of people with a range of B-cell (a type of white blood cell) mediated immune conditions like systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD) and other connective tissue diseases.
What if remission were the target of lupus care?
BEHIND THE SCIENCE MAGAZINE
What if remission were the target of lupus care?
Refractory chronic cough
Approximately 28 million people suffer from chronic cough, with about 10 million worldwide suffering from refractory chronic cough (RCC). RCC is a cough that persists for more than eight weeks and doesn’t respond to treatment for an underlying condition or is otherwise unexplained. For decades there have been no effective treatments for RCC.
We are currently exploring treatments that may be able to target certain receptors in the body to reduce cough frequency in people living with RCC, while demonstrating increased quality of life.
Low-carbon inhalers
Metered dose inhalers (MDI) are a cornerstone of asthma treatment for millions of patients, but the propellent used in traditional MDIs also contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. Recognising the environmental impact, we are researching  the use of a lower global warming potential propellant to create a low-carbon inhaler. If successful, this will advance our commitment to reduce our inhaler carbon footprint by approximately 90%.

Home Investors Shareholder information Our ADR programme
Our ADR programme
GSK trades in the US on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol GSK and has an established ADR programme with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JP Morgan), our depository bank.
What are ADRs and ADSs?
An American Depository Receipt (ADR) is issued by a depository bank (JP Morgan in GSK’s case), and is used to represent a specific number of shares of a non-US company traded on a US stock exchange. This allows non-US companies to make their shares available outside their home markets and allows investors in the US and elsewhere to easily invest in companies.

American Depository Shares (ADS) are the actual shares which are traded and, in the case of GSK, listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The terms ADR and ADS are often used interchangeably.

One GSK ADR represents two Ordinary Shares. 
Benefits of ADRs to investors
ADRs are a convenient and cost-effective way for US investors to buy shares in international companies. Benefits include:

Stocks are quoted in US dollars
Dividends are paid in US dollars
ADRs trade during normal US trading hours
ADRs settle and clear according to US standards
No need for custody arrangements outside of the US
Facilitates price comparisons between securities listed in the US
Role of depository bank
As depositary bank for GSK, JP Morgan engages in a number of functions including:

Issuing and cancelling ADRs
Serving as transfer agent for the ADRs and custodian for the ordinary shares
Acting as paying agent, processing dividend payments or other entitlements for the ADR holders
Processing corporate actions
Co-ordinating the proxy process for ADR holders
How ADRs are issued and cancelled
Investors may purchase pre-existing ADRs, if available, or newly issued ADRs. Issuing ADRs does not increase GSK’s share capital as they are simply representative of the underlying ordinary shares.
Where new ADRs are to be issued, ordinary shares are purchased in the home market and deposited with a local custodian, who instructs the depositary to issue ADRs which represent the shares received.
If you wish to convert your ordinary shares into ADRs, please contact your broker or investment advisor.
ADR certificates
Your GSK ADR represents your ownership of shares in the company and can be held in certificated or book-entry form.
If you hold your ADRs in certificate form these should be kept in a secure place. Certificates are negotiable documents and should be signed only in the event of a sale or transfer of ownership. If you lose your ADR certificate, please contact JP Morgan immediately to request paperwork to begin the replacement process. Replacing your ADR certificate may incur a fee.
If you hold your ADRs through a ‘Street name’ (nominee account), these will be in book-entry form and therefore you will not have an ADR certificate. Please contact your bank or broker for any questions regarding your ADRs.
Share consolidation – ADR certificates
On July 18, 2022, GSK plc consolidated its share capital (the “Share Consolidation”) pursuant to which holders received 4 new GSK ordinary shares for every 5 existing GSK ordinary shares held as at 8:00 pm (UK time) on July 18, 2022. As a result of the Share Consolidation, ADR holders received 4 new ADS for every 5 ADS outstanding as of 9:30 am (New York time) on July 19, 2022. Further information can be found on the Consumer Healthcare Demerger page.
If you hold your GSK ADS in certificated form you will have received a Letter of Transmittal from EQ Shareowner Services in July and October this year. To receive your consolidated GSK ADS and any future dividend payments, you will need to complete and return the Letter of Transmittal along with your ADS certificate(s) to EQ Shareowner Services in the prepaid envelope enclosed with the mailing.
If you need assistance with the completion of the Letter of Transmittal or have any questions, please call EQ Shareowner Services using the contact details found on the Investors contact details page.
Contact and FAQs
Contact details for JP Morgan can be found on the Investors contact details page.

We get ahead of disease together by preventing and treating it with innovation in specialty medicines and vaccines. Our R&D approach combines our scientific focus on the immune system - with the use of advanced technologies.
We are working to deliver a new generation of differentiated, needed vaccines and medicines in four core therapeutic areas where we have the strongest expertise, and where significant patient need remains: respiratory, immunology and inflammation; oncology, HIV; and infectious diseases.
Technology powers all aspects of our R&D. We use human genetics and functional genomics, along with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), to deeply understand the patient, human biology, and disease mechanisms. This is leading to real breakthroughs for tackling a range of conditions, such as liver disease, or transforming HIV treatment and prevention. 
We believe the powerful combination of science and technology holds the key to fundamentally transforming medical discovery for the better, making the R&D process more dynamic, improving success rates and shaping how even the most challenging diseases, like neurological conditions and cancer, can be both prevented and treated.
Discover our leading scientists
There’s never been a time when science and technology have formed such a powerful union as they do now. We’re able to identify drug discovery targets using genomics and AI/ML in a way that is unprecedented. We’re also able to use more approaches than ever before to design new medicines and vaccines to address the root cause of disease.

You’ll learn to understand their needs, share crucial information about our products, and drive business growth through exceptional customer service.
You may also work in a brand or customer marketing rotation, where you’ll develop and execute marketing strategies, manage globally aligned campaigns, and analyse market trends. You’ll gather insights into customer and patient preferences, learning what drives sales and influences market success.
An optional third rotation will help you further develop your understanding of commercial. You will deepen your expertise by working in areas within commercial excellence or market access like omnichannel, digital & tech, insights & analytics, consumer marketing insights, life cycle innovation, new assets launch excellence, pricing & market access, or competitive brand strategy. This rotation will deepen your understanding of the commercial landscape and equip you with the strategic capabilities needed to excel in a rapidly evolving industry.

Corporate sponsored nominee service
The GSK corporate sponsored nominee service is a convenient way to manage your GSK shares without a share certificate.
The service Transfer your GSK shares FAQs Contact our registrars
The service
The service is provided by Computershare and is open to residents of Permitted Countries who are aged 18 years or over. The Permitted Countries list may be updated from time to time with the current list displayed on Computershare’s website.
It provides a facility for shareholders to remove their shares from the GSK share register and hold them together with other shareholders in a nominee company sponsored by GSK.
Shareholders participating in this service continue to receive dividend payments, annual reports and can attend and vote at GSK’s general meetings.
The shareholder is still the beneficial owner of the shares and simply instructs the nominee to buy/sell or transfer the holding on its behalf.
The service is free to join and it ensures that shareholders details are not held in the public domain.
How to transfer the shares you hold into the GSK corporate sponsored nominee
If you currently hold GSK shares in a certificated form, you can transfer your holding into the GSK corporate sponsored nominee by downloading and completing a Request for Deposit (C-I) which is available on Investor Centre or www.computershare.co.uk/nominee. You will need to complete the form and send it together with your share certificate(s) to Computershare.
You are strongly advised to send your share certificate(s) and the form by recorded or registered post as your share certificate is a valuable document.
If it is lost in the post you will be required to complete an indemnity before your shares can be transferred into the Nominee account.

Apprentice programmes
Start a brilliant career with hands-on experience from day one.
Why an apprentice programme could be the perfect fit for you 
  An apprenticeship is a smart alternative route for students who are eager to kickstart their careers. At GSK, our apprentices have the opportunity to learn directly from industry experts from the very beginning. Through hands-on experience, you will gain valuable insights and practical skills by working with our world-class business. By taking on more responsibility earlier, you can reach your career goals while still pursuing academic and industry-accredited qualifications.
If you’re a school leaver with a passion for science, engineering, manufacturing, or business operations, and you’re looking to start your career in a global company whose purpose is to get ahead of disease together, then our apprentice programmes could be perfect for you.
We value your unique strengths and motivations. That's why we encourage you to choose the area of our business where you believe your skills and interests align the most. Whichever team you join, you will play a key role in helping us achieve our goals.
We offer apprenticeships across the markets where we operate including UK and US. To explore the specific apprenticeship offerings in your location search for open positions using #Apprenticeships.

Sharing Clinical Trial Data
GSK is committed to provide access to anonymised patient-level data that sit behind the results of clinical trials. GSK-sponsored interventional clinical trials conducted with products will be listed for data sharing once a medicine has been approved by regulators or terminated from development, and the study has been accepted for publication. External researchers can request access to anonymised patient-level clinical trial data and supporting clinical trial documents through the multi-sponsor data sharing portals. It is hoped that sharing these data with researchers will help to further scientific research, increase understanding of new and current medicines and ultimately improve patient care.

About the GSK Study Register
The GSK Study Register provides information on our studies and publications.

Layperson Summary of Clinical Trial Results
GSK is committed to developing Layperson Summaries of Clinical Trial Results (also referred to as Plain Language Summaries) in a way that is understandable by members of the general public. Sharing these summaries is a crucial part of showing respect to volunteers who participated in our clinical trials and our commitment to providing access to information about our research and their results to patients, healthcare providers and the wider public.

About the GSK Study Register
The GSK Study Register provides information about studies such as study documents, locations and eligibility criteria for participating. The information is useful for researchers and patients. It supplements information presented in scientific journals, at scientific congresses, in letters to healthcare professionals, and in approved prescribing information. We aim to publish our clinical research as papers in the scientific literature.
We provide publication citations with studies on this register. Where there is no citation the study has not yet been published. For a small number of studies, a publication is not being progressed. This may be because it has been rejected by journals or because it is unlikely to be published by journals - for example where a study is terminated early with little or no data.
GSK has alliances with other organisations. As part of these alliances, GSK may not have been the regulatory sponsor of all clinical studies for a product and therefore the results of such studies may not appear on this register. Please see other public registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov or EU Clinical Trials Register for any study disclosures from our alliance partners.

Clinical Study Transparency
GSK’s Long-Standing Commitment
to Clinical Study Transparency
We recognise the importance of publicly disclosing clinical research on our products. In 2004 we introduced the GSK Study Register, a place where anyone can access information about the clinical research we carry out. We were the first pharmaceutical company to do this.
Our clinical study results are made public regardless of whether they are positive or negative. When a study begins, we post a protocol summary, which includes the study’s objectives and design. Once the study has completed, we provide a summary of the results. We also disclose full protocols, statistical analysis plans, clinical study reports and regulatory overview documents as well as list studies for data sharing.

Home Responsibility Environment Materials and waste
Materials and waste
We are committed to reducing our operational waste and reducing the environmental impact of our products and packaging. Here, we detail our materials and waste targets and how we aim to achieve them.
Our materials and waste targets
Zero operational waste1 by 2030
25% environmental impact reduction for our products and packaging by 2030
10% waste reduction from our supply chain by 2030
  Notes:
1 Target updated in 2024 to remove specific reference to the elimination of operational single-use plastics. This work has been integrated into the overall operational waste target
How we plan to achieve our targets

Operational waste
We will achieve zero operational waste through a 20% reduction in the amount of both hazardous and non-hazardous waste we generate, and diverting the material we do generate into circular cycles - for example reuse, recycling and composting.

We continue to build on our long-standing operational waste management programme to identify opportunities to find more beneficial uses for waste, including providing by-products from our manufacturing processes to other industries as a raw material.

Products and product packaging
We have committed to a 25% environmental impact reduction for product and packaging by 2030. We will achieve this through integrating environmental aspects into the product design process for all new products and selected established products - with the aim of improving the environmental performance of the product throughout its whole life cycle. This includes using recycled card in packaging, e-leaflets for vaccines and more efficient manufacturing methods.
From 2024, all newly developed or acquired medicines will now have Sustainable Design Plans applied. These use industry-leading product sustainability methodologies to include environmental considerations at every step of the product decision-making process, from design to disposal.
We are a founding member of the Circularity in Primary Pharmaceutical Packaging Accelerator, a collaborative initiative across the pharmaceutical supply chain to develop and deploy solutions for the recycling of primary pharmaceutical packaging.

Supply chain
We’re working on a supply chain waste footprint to help prioritise procurement of materials that generate less waste and to support supplier engagement on waste reduction.

Global health
We are changing the trajectory of high burden diseases in lower income countries, with a focus on infectious diseases.
Where you live continues to define your chances of enjoying a healthy life.
Amongst the biggest drivers of morbidity and mortality in lower income countries are tuberculosis (TB), malaria, HIV, anti-microbial resistance (AMR), as well as Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). We believe that focusing on prevention and treatment of these high burden infectious diseases is a critical part of the global response to address health challenges in lower income countries.
Our rich heritage as a leader in global health gives us a unique and important role to play in improving health for patients around the world. By using our science, technology, talent and partnerships, we’ll deliver health impact at scale.

References
The methodology for calculating our patient reach impact is derived from a detailed product level analysis of actual sales and long-range forecasts by individual countries. It purely accounts for the number of people receiving a GSK product (reach), not the outcomes or benefits they derive. The analysis uses conservative assumptions to ensure people are only counted once, even if they experience two or more of GSK’s vaccines or medicines during the 10-year period. The methodology and the data have been reviewed and validated externally. Budget phasing is not linear across the 10-year period.

Chief Medical Officer
Sabine Luik, MD, MBA has been our Chief Medical Officer (CMO) since 2018. She reports directly to the Chief Scientific Officer.
Throughout her time with GSK, her leadership has ensured our regulatory, quality, safety, medical affairs and value evidence and outcomes teams, as well as development groups in China and Japan, work together to successfully achieve our ambitions for patients.
The organisation of the CMO, including Global Regulatory, Safety & Quality, is responsible for benefit-risk decision making for pipeline and marketed medicines and vaccines, Safety and Pharmacovigilance, Epidemiology, Bioethics, Medical Governance, Regulatory Policy, Quality and risk management (including data governance).
Across her organisation, her teams are driven by delivering what matters better and faster, always in the right way, for patients around the world.
Follow Sabine on LinkedIn
Success in medicine development is directly tied to applying diverse views to problem solving. At GSK we constantly work to ensure clinical trial participants are representative of the patient populations affected by the diseases we aim to treat. Trials that reflect the true diversity of the population impacted by a disease – for example a women’s health issue – will lead to better insights in the development of a medicine and how it is prescribed for patients.

For over 70 years we have been at the forefront of research into diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Our infectious diseases portfolio is one of the broadest in the industry, and includes vaccines, antibiotics, antivirals and anti-fungals.

Applying our expertise to tackle infectious diseases

View video on YouTube
Infectious diseases are responsible for one in six deaths globally. There is a huge need for innovation to tackle chronic infections, seasonal infections, common childhood diseases, rare but devastating conditions such as meningitis, and a range of bacterial infections made more challenging by antimicrobial resistance; as well as diseases which largely impact lower-income countries like malaria and tuberculosis.
We are also committed to addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which disproportionately affect some of the world's most vulnerable populations. We are providing access to medicines, supporting disease surveillance and control programmes, and advocating for increased awareness and resources to combat NTDs.
Our combined expertise in vaccines and medicines means we can focus on both the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, resulting in significant public health benefits, reduced deaths and increased productivity.
Respiratory viruses
We’ve been leaders in delivering medicines that help manage respiratory conditions for over 50 years. Respiratory illnesses - such as flu, bronchitis, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), asthma and COPD - have a significant impact on global health. We are committed to developing treatments that can reduce the burden of respiratory diseases, improve health outcomes, and save lives.
We are also working to prevent these illnesses. We research seasonal viruses that cause diseases like bronchitis which pose a significant risk to older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions. We are also exploring ways to protect against a broader range of respiratory viruses using advanced vaccine technologies, such as adjuvants and next-generation mRNA.

Anti-infectives research
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) already causes over one million deaths each year. Without urgent action, by 2050 almost 40 million lives will have been lost. Across our pipeline we have over 30 projects relevant to AMR, 12 of them targeting pathogens deemed ‘critical’ or ‘urgent’ by WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We are actively addressing the challenge of AMR, including the development of novel antibiotics for antibiotic-resistant infections.
AMR is particularly prevalent in low-resource settings. We continue to research treatments against several enteric diseases that contribute to the burden of AMR, including salmonella, typhoid, shigella and paratyphoid fever. We collaborate with governments, international organisations, and academic institutions to share knowledge, resources, and expertise to accelerate the development of new antibiotics, promote responsible use of existing treatments, and implement effective strategies to combat AMR on a global scale.

Shingles
Shingles or herpes zoster is a painful and debilitating disease caused by reactivation of the same virus that causes varicella (chickenpox), sometimes with serious consequences like long-term nerve pain and loss of vision. One in three people will develop shingles in their lifetime. 
We collaborate with healthcare partners to continuously improve our understanding of shingles and develop innovative solutions that can enhance prevention, diagnosis, and management of the disease.

PATIENT STORY
Shingles pain and impact
Acute bacterial infections
Meningitis: One in six people who get bacterial meningitis die and one in five face serious complications. To protect as many children and adolescents as possible, we are working to build a comprehensive understanding of the disease mechanisms to effectively target and treat meningitis. We are deepening our understanding of the different serotypes of the bacteria that cause the disease to help us to develop vaccines that specifically target and combat the strains of bacteria causing meningitis. This may offer broader protection and can lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
Pneumococcal disease is the name for any illness caused by the streptococcus pneumoniae bacterium, such as pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis. Approximately one million children die of pneumococcal disease every year. Vaccines available today only cover about 60% of circulating disease, leaving many vulnerable people at risk of being severely sick or hospitalised with pneumonia, sepsis or meningitis – and even death. Vaccines with broader protection may help to prevent these diseases from the start. We are leveraging MAPS technology to explore how we can provide broader and stronger protection against pneumococcal disease to improve the health and well-being of individuals worldwide.
Chronic hepatitis B (CHB)
CHB is a major global health issue, affecting more than 250 million people across the world. The WHO estimates only 10% of these people have a diagnosis. Almost a million people die each year from hepatitis B and related complications, such as liver cancer.
Our expertise in infectious disease, immunology and human genetics has driven research into CHB for over 35 years. Through our research we have improved understanding of the heterogeneous nature of hepatitis B infections which will help progress towards a comprehensive, functional cure for people living with CHB, a common cause of chronic liver disease. We aim to eliminate the need for continued therapy, ultimately reducing the long-term risk of developing liver complications.
  Millions of people living with chronic hepatitis B are unaware they have the virus. So why aren’t they getting diagnosed?

Our response to the crisis in Israel and Gaza
We are deeply concerned by the traumatic events that have taken place in Israel and Gaza over recent weeks.

As a company dedicated to human health and care for people, we believe the best contribution we can make is to ensure the safety and security of our people, and get life-saving medicines and vaccines to the people who need them.

We are in close contact with emergency relief organisations on the ground to understand their needs and how we can support.

We have made initial commitments to two humanitarian organisations:
Israel’s national aid agency (Magen David Adom) to support victims in Israel of the attacks by Hamas and provide ongoing first aid and emergency medical services for communities in Israel affected by the hostilities.
Save the Children, to support children and their families in Gaza with the immediate priorities of clothing, food, water and essential health services.
We are also working with our established partner, Direct Relief, to assess and provide emergency supplies of GSK products to meet essential healthcare needs, in line with our global health policies.
We will continue to monitor the situation to ensure our humanitarian response to this crisis is as effective as possible.

Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002
Find out how GSK conforms with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.
The Sarbanes-Oxley code of ethics
Sarbanes-Oxley requires GSK to have a code of ethics "applicable to its Principal financial officer and controller or Principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions".
The code is defined as having standards that promote:
honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships
full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in the periodic reports required to be filed by the issuer
compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations
GSK formulated a Sarbanes-Oxley code of ethics around seven policies:
The Code 
Company assets and proprietary information
External communications to investors and media; external speaking engagements and publications
Political contributions
Preventing corrupt practices and maintaining standards of documentation
Risk management and legal compliance
Share dealing
Our code of ethics goes beyond the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, in that it is applicable to all employees. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have both signed statements certifying their compliance with the code of ethics, as have the Senior Vice President, Financial Controller and the Senior Vice President, Finance Services.

Consumer Healthcare Demerger
Documents Demerger - completion GSK Share Consolidation Tax Further questions
Consumer Healthcare Demerger – background
On Monday 18 July 2022, GSK plc (“GSK” or the “Company”) separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form Haleon plc (“Haleon”), an independent listed company. The separation was effected by way of a demerger (the “Demerger”) of approximately 80% of GSK’s 68% holding in the Consumer Healthcare business to GSK’s shareholders.
The Consumer Healthcare business was a joint venture between GSK and Pfizer Inc (“Pfizer”), with GSK holding a majority controlling interest of 68% and Pfizer holding 32%.
A General Meeting to approve two resolutions covering: the Demerger and the GSK Share Consolidation; and the Related Party Transactions, was held on Wednesday 6 July 2022 at 2.30pm UK. Both resolutions set out in the Notice of General Meeting (included in the Circular to Shareholders dated 1 June 2022) were duly passed by shareholders. Discover further information regarding the General Meeting.
The Circular in relation to the Demerger and the Prospectus regarding the admission of Haleon’s ordinary shares to the Premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (“LSE”) were published by GSK and Haleon respectively on Wednesday 1 June 2022.

Demerger – completion and shareholder entitlement
The Demerger completed on Monday 18 July 2022 and GSK shareholders received one Haleon plc share for each GSK plc share held at 6.00pm UK on Friday 15 July 2022. If you were a GSK shareholder at that time you are now a shareholder in both GSK and Haleon. Haleon is a FTSE 100 company which started trading on the LSE’s Main Market at 8.00am UK on Monday 18 July 2022.
You can find more about Haleon, including share price information, at www.haleon.com.
The announcement confirming the completion of the Demerger.
Information relevant to GSK American Depositary Share (“ADS”) holders can be found in the Circular on pages 93 to 96.
GSK Share Consolidation
Following the Demerger, on Monday 18 July 2022 GSK consolidated its share capital (“GSK Share Consolidation”). This means shareholders received 4 new GSK shares of nominal value 31 1/4 pence each for every 5 existing GSK shares of nominal value 25 pence each held at 8.00pm UK on that date.
GSK’s post-consolidated shares started trading on the LSE’s Main Market at 8.00am UK on Tuesday 19 July 2022.
The announcement confirming the completion of the GSK Share Consolidation.
Information relevant to GSK ADS holders can be found in the Circular on pages 93 to 96.
What is a share consolidation?
A share consolidation reduces the total number of shares in circulation which should increase the price per share.
As a result, each GSK shareholder will have fewer shares, but each remaining share should be more valuable. Consolidation itself does not change the value of someone’s GSK shareholding.
The consolidation applies only to GSK shares, not the Haleon shares each GSK shareholder received at Demerger.
How many GSK shares do I now own?
You can find out how many GSK shares you owned immediately following the GSK Share Consolidation by entering the number of GSK shares you held at 6.00pm UK on Friday 15 July 2022 into the box below:
(This assumes you did not sell any of your GSK shares on Monday 18 July 2022).
This calculator tool can be used to give you an indication of either the number of GSK shares or ADSs that you held immediately following the GSK Share Consolidation as the ratio used to consolidate both types of share was the same. The tool rounds down the number of consolidated shares that you held.
Important: this calculator tool aims to provide an approximate indication of what the GSK Share Consolidation means for your GSK shares. It should not be taken as legal or financial advice and is not a substitute for consulting a qualified professional. The actual number of consolidated GSK shares you received can be obtained from the service provider or nominee through which you hold your GSK shares.
Calculate the value of your GSK holding
Use the share calculator to find out how much your GSK shares are currently worth.

(You can find out how much your Haleon shares are worth at www.haleon.com)
GSK fractional entitlements
Depending on the number of GSK shares you held before Demerger, the Share Consolidation may mean your new entitlement does not add up to a whole number of GSK shares and includes a fraction of one share. This is called “a fractional entitlement”.
If this applies to you, depending on where your GSK shares or ADSs are held, your fractional entitlement was either automatically sold on your behalf (and you will receive the proceeds of the sale in cash) or the fractional share has been added to your GSK shareholding account.
Remember that the sum involved will always be less than the value of a single GSK share or ADS.
To receive any fractional entitlements and future dividend payments on your GSK shares you must provide your bank account details to Equiniti, the Registrar. Equiniti will retain any payments owed to you until these details are provided. Equiniti’s contact details.
ADS holders should contact the Depositary for details on the receipt of fractional entitlements. The Depositary’s contact details.
Tax
Information on the tax impact of the Demerger and GSK Share Consolidation for UK and US shareholders can be found on pages 83 to 87 of the Circular dated 1 June 2022.
Further information on the tax base cost allocation to assist UK shareholders apportion their base cost between their GSK plc shares and Haleon plc shares for UK capital gains tax purposes following the demerger, including a worked example.
Under the provisions of Section 6045B of the Internal Revenue Code, a company (whether domestic or foreign) must report to the IRS, or post on the company’s website, certain specified information with respect to any organisational action that affects the tax basis of US shareholders in their shares. Please find Form 8937 along with supplementary information.
Update for Canadian shareholders (May 2023)
GSK submitted an application to the Canadian Revenue Authority ("CRA") requesting confirmation that the Demerger would be treated as an eligible spin-off and that the receipt of Haleon plc shares on Demerger would therefore be exempt from income tax in Canada. 
We are disappointed to advise that, unfortunately, the CRA has advised us that they have determined that the distribution does not qualify for the exemption under section 86.1 of the Income Tax Act (Canada).
We are not able to give specific personal tax advice.  However, in the absence of an exemption, the receipt of the Haleon plc shares on Demerger would generally be taxable as a foreign dividend in Canada.
This information is for general guidance purposes only and does not constitute tax advice. If you are in any doubt as to your tax position we strongly recommend that you consult an appropriate professional adviser.

Home Investors Shareholder information Manage your shares
Manage your shares
There are a number of ways you can manage your GSK shares. Please read on to find out more.
You can manage your UK shares and request changes to your details on the Investor Centre (computershare.com).
If you register with Computershare Investor Centre you will be able to make the following changes online:
Change address details
Change bank account details for dividend payments
Update your communication preference
Join Reinvestment Plans
Sell your shares
Your dividend payments
In April 2020 GSK simplified the way it makes dividend payments. All cash dividends are now only distributed by direct credit.
You will need to provide Computershare, our registrar, with your bank details for your dividends to be paid directly to your nominated account by direct credit. If you do not provide this information, you will still receive an annual dividend statement; however, you will not receive the money until your bank details are received, after which payment will be credited to your bank or building society account as soon as possible. Your dividends will not accrue interest while they are being held for you and there may be a fee for Computershare to reissue payments.
Please see our FAQs for further information on this change. Alternatively, you can contact Computershare directly. Their contact details can be found on the Investors contact details page.
Reinvest your dividends to buy more shares
With the GSK Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) you can use your cash dividends to buy more shares in GSK. As an alternative to the dividend payment, your cash will be used to buy additional shares. The DRIP is a convenient, easy and cost-effective way to build your shareholding.
To apply for the GSK DRIP, visit the Investor Centre.
US-based shareholders
US-based shareholders should contact JP Morgan ADR shareholder services. Their contact details can be found on the Investors contact details page.
The Depositary also provides Global Invest Direct, an ADS purchase/sale and dividend reinvestment plan for ADR holders. Current participants in the BNY Global BuyDIRECT will receive a welcome letter via US Mail with instructions for activating their new Global Invest Direct account.

Further information regarding signing up for Global Invest Direct can be obtained by visiting www.shareowneronline.com or call the above helpline number to obtain an enrollment pack.

General Meeting
Demerger General Meeting archive
Demerger
On Monday 18 July 2022, GSK plc (“GSK” or the “Company”) separated its Consumer Healthcare business from the GSK Group to form Haleon plc (“Haleon”), an independent listed company. The separation was effected by way of a demerger (the “Demerger”) of approximately 80% of GSK’s 68% holding in the Consumer Healthcare business to GSK’s shareholders.
The Consumer Healthcare business was a joint venture between GSK and Pfizer Inc (“Pfizer”), with GSK holding a majority controlling interest of 68% and Pfizer holding 32%.
A General Meeting to approve two resolutions covering: the Demerger and the GSK Share Consolidation; and the Related Party Transactions, was held on Wednesday 6 July 2022 at 2.30pm. Both resolutions set out in the Notice of General Meeting (included in the Circular to Shareholders published on 1 June 2022) were duly passed by shareholders. Further information can be found below.

The General Meeting was held on Wednesday 6 July 2022 at 2.30 p.m. (UK time) at the Sofitel London Heathrow, Terminal 5, London Heathrow Airport, TW6 2GD and was broadcast live for shareholders to join electronically.
At the General Meeting both resolutions set out in the Notice of General Meeting (included in the Circular to Shareholders (PDF - 670kb) published on 1 June 2022) were duly passed by shareholders. The full text of the two resolutions tabled at the General Meeting is contained on pages 157 to 159 of the Notice of General Meeting.
The Demerger completed on Monday 18 July 2022 and GSK shareholders received one Haleon plc share for each GSK plc share held at 6.00pm UK on Friday 15 July 2022.

GSK’s post-consolidated shares started trading on the LSE’s Main Market at 8.00am UK on Tuesday 19 July 2022.

Home Innovation Our leading scientists Dr Hesham Ahmed Abdullah
Dr Hesham Ahmed Abdullah
Senior Vice President, Global Head Oncology, Research & Development
Hesham A. Abdullah is Senior Vice President, Global Head Oncology, Research & Development at GSK. Hesham is a seasoned physician-scientist who uniquely combines a clinician’s understanding of the impact cancer has on patients with deep expertise in identifying transformational opportunities to improve cancer treatment and care.
As the head of GSK’s global oncology research and development (R&D) team, Hesham oversees 300 oncology researchers around the world. Under Hesham’s leadership, GSK’s Oncology Therapeutic Area has built a portfolio of cornerstone assets, transforming promising molecules into medicines that are helping people to live well beyond cancer. Taking a precision medicine approach to identify patients most likely to respond to new modalities and harnessing the power of advanced technologies in the drug development process has been key to Hesham’s success in delivering breakthrough medicines in the treatment of cancer. 
Hesham’s experience spans the breadth of early and late stages of development, in solid tumours and hematological malignancies. In his more than two decades leading global biopharmaceutical research and development teams and organisations, Hesham has applied his scientific background, pharmaceutical leadership experience, and personal inspiration for patient-centric research to successfully deliver 12 novel precision oncology approvals across targeted small molecules, antibodies, immunotherapy and ADCs and the registration of the companion diagnostics for many of these assets. 

Under his oversight, GSK has returned to oncology with four novel medicines approved over the past four years, a pipeline of 15+ clinical stage oncology assets and a large number of research phase programs incorporating new technologies to get ahead of cancer and to address significant gaps in treatment and unmet medical needs.
Follow Hesham on LinkedIn
Cancer continues to impact our lives in different ways, whether the diagnosis affects you personally or a loved one. All of us working in oncology research and development are aware of the significant unmet needs that continue to exist across many cancer types. For me, the work I’ve done over my 20+ year career, as a physician-scientist, contributing to the research, development and registration of over a dozen targeted cancer therapies has deeply been personal. This has shaped how I show up each day firmly committed to advancing cancer treatments for current and future patients.

Human rights
We are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights wherever we do business. Please read on to find out more about our policies in this important area.
Human rights Our five priority areas Governance External engagement Grievance mechanisms

We are committed to respecting internationally recognised human rights wherever we do business.
In our Code we say that this means “we strive to prevent, mitigate, and remedy adverse impacts that our business activities or business relationships may have on the human rights of our colleagues, patients, workers in our supply chain and those who live in the communities in which we operate”. Our Human Rights Position Statement (PDF - 196.7kb) lays out our commitment to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the core labour standards set out by the International Labour Organisation.
In alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (PDF - 1.08MB), we periodically carry out company-wide human rights risk assessments to identify our most significant human rights risks. In 2024, we refreshed our salient issues – those areas where GSK’s potential to impact on human rights is greatest – to better understand where our operations, subsidiaries and supply chain may potentially adversely impact individuals and communities.
We engaged external stakeholders and considered employees and potential recruits, patients, clinical trial participants, third-party and supply chain workers, as well as communities. The five salient human rights risk areas below were identified:

Our policy position on Human Rights
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (PDF - 1.08MB)
Governance
Our GSK Leadership Team and the Risk Oversight & Compliance Council, the most senior leaders in our business, provide oversight of our human rights issues. They are supported by a Human Rights Steering Group. Additional board-level oversight is provided by the Corporate Responsibility Committee.
Board of directors and leadership team
Governance
External engagement
We partner with other companies and organisations to increase the positive impact we have on society. Key collaborations include the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI) where we contribute to a number of projects to build members’ and suppliers’ capabilities to address human rights; and Business for Social Responsibility (BSR) where we work with other pharmaceutical companies to understand human rights.
Grievance mechanisms
We want to maintain an open environment where people feel confident to raise concerns about possible breaches of our Code or suspected violations of country laws and regulations. Anyone within or outside GSK can raise issues or speak to an independent third party through our Speak Up facility,available in 49 languages, confidentially or anonymously if they prefer. GSK is committed to promptly investigating all reports of unethical, illegal or inappropriate activity.
Speak up
Codes and policies
Our Code is the foundation of our company policies. It sets out the core standards and ethical behaviours that employees and complementary workers should apply in their daily work and embeds respect for human rights and labour rights across the business. The Code is underpinned by several policies and standard operating procedures that help to uphold human rights.
Our Human Rights Policy sets out our commitment to conduct business with respect for international human rights standards.
Our Global Employment Guidelines and Working with Third Parties Policy set out the minimum standards for our own employment practices and those expected of our third party partners. They are based on international standards, including the International Labour Organization core conventions, and prohibit any form of forced labour or child labour. They also make clear our expectation that no worker should pay for a job.
Our Standard Operating Procedure for Safeguarding and Non-retaliation defines our approach to protecting and supporting individuals who work for GSK and report concerns of significant misconduct in good faith (including exploitative labour practices).
Other relevant policies include those on Equal and Inclusive Treatment of Employees, Pre-employment Screening, Conflict Minerals, Deforestation-Free Sourcing and Anti-bribery and Corruption.

Pipeline progress
The content of our development pipeline will change over time as new projects progress from research to development and from development to the market.
Phases of clinical development
Our products in development progress through three stages: phase I, phase II and phase III/registrational. Each of these phases allows us to assess the safety and efficacy of our investigational products to eventually provide data to support applications for regulatory approval. For competitive reasons, new projects in pre-clinical development are not disclosed and some project types may not be identified.

Connections to a secure, reliable, and more decarbonized world of energy
Integrating renewable energy sources and decarbonizing existing electricity infrastructure are key to meeting society’s energy needs while fighting climate change. Yet, these contributions to more carbon-neutral energy take place in remote areas often hundreds or even thousands of kilometers away from the centers of consumption. Effective solutions are vital to connecting all distributed power generation sources to the grid to make electricity available where it is really needed.
Siemens Energy supplies a comprehensive range of reliable, efficient, and proven transmission systems as grid access solutions that meet and master these challenges.

Driving a resilient future: key energy transition strategies
Five energy transition strategies we’re taking to transform the energy system.
The energy transition promises to herald in a future where electricity becomes the core of our energy systems and huge leaps in clean energy innovation further drive down the prices of renewable energy and create a rapid shift away from coal and oil toward an economy powered by carbon-neutral, hydrogen-based fuels. Yet today, energy is still responsible for more than 70 percent of emissions, and the climate crisis is already affecting every region of the planet, leaving aging energy systems vulnerable to strain and disruption. More than ever, the world needs a new energy era, one resilient enough to recover quickly from shocks and support the global economy.
As climate change accelerates and the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions grows, governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide increasingly recognize the need to adopt energy transition strategies that promote both environmental sustainability and economic resilience. But time is of the essence. 2024 was the hottest recorded year on earth and the first to pass the 1.5°C warming limit. 
To avoid the worst impacts of climate change, we need to act now with five strategies to drive the energy transition:

Brownfield transformation: Repowering power plants
Get on the road to a decarbonized future by converting your brownfield power plant
* Above figures are estimates
Today increasingly ambitious CO₂ targets are being set around the world. Reaching them won’t come about by itself. Apart from intelligent energy management and improved energy efficiency, we need to decarbonize power generation for utilities and industry. And since we can’t rebuild energy generation from scratch, assets viewed as burdensome today, such as coal power plants, must be repurposed as bridges to a new energy future.  Converting existing power plants, so they help us reach the decarbonized economy we all aim for.

Renewable sources including solar, wind, hydropower and biofuels are vital in the transition towards less carbon-intensive energy systems. And while the generation of electricity from the sun and wind has grown rapidly in recent years, further expansion is urgently needed to keep the 1.5°C climate target within reach. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), an average of 1,000GW of renewable energy capacity needs to be added every year until 2030.
Much more needs to be done across the value chain: making the grid more robust, increasing storage and using more green hydrogen and derivatives in high-emission industries such as transportation. We work every day to supply our partners with the technologies they need to effect these changes.
Renewable energy is key to the energy transition
The new energy landscape, fueled by renewable sources, is revolutionizing patterns of power generation, distribution, and consumption. This energy transition plays a crucial role in achieving a sustainable and environmentally responsible future for our planet.

Today’s electricity grid isn’t ready for tomorrow
We’re supporting companies and countries to strengthen and expand critical infrastructure
Making renewables fully deliverable
Today’s electricity grids are not equipped to handle a major rise in renewable energy. By 2030, the global length of transmission lines needs to increase by almost 2.5m km, and distribution networks by over 16m km.
Making progress with our customers
We’re on a sustained drive to help our customers make the transmission of energy more sustainable. Almost 1400 installations of products from our F-gas-free Blue portfolio are now in operation worldwide, saving 2.5m tons of CO2e emissions.
" As the demand for renewables power generation increases, we need to expand and modernize our transmission grids. If not, renewable energy cannot reach its full potential”
Tim Holt, Member of the Executive Board, Siemens Energy
Specific challenges and solutions
We focus on enabling our customers to upgrade electrical grids in two ways:
Increasing robustness
The existing infrastructure needs to be made more resilient and flexible to cope with fluctuations in energy supply and ever-increasing demand.
Our highly efficient Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) play an important role in balancing these fluctuations and maintaining robustness. We also offer the world’s most sustainable portfolio of grid technologies, including high-voltage clean-air switchgear and transformers, HVDC services and digital solutions.
Expanding storage
Energy storage systems are crucial to the energy transition, ensuring 24/7 availability of electricity from renewable sources. We are developing a variety of storage solutions, including batteries and green hydrogen.
In addition, our HVDC technology makes possible the exchange of electricity across borders, enabling different national power grids to support each other.
Energy transition targets
We have definite aims for strengthening the power grids:
By offering an innovative portfolio to enable the creation of a transmission network strong enough and large enough to meet the demands of the future
By actively advocating the reduction and acceleration of approval procedures to speed up the expansion of grids

Driving the energy transition
Discover strategies, solutions, and technologies to move the energy transition forward
The energy transition is one of the most pressing global challenges of our time. It requires the shift towards more sustainable low carbon alternatives to limit earth’s warming to below 2º C. However, at 37.7 billion metric tons, global energy related CO2 emissions reached a new record in 2023. Current policies predict global CO2 emissions will peak soon, but without a significant decline, we’re on track for a 2.4º C temperature rise by the end of the century.
Embracing the energy transition for a sustainable, zero-carbon world
The energy transition is our main tool to lower emissions. It is a gradual and steady move away from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources and a zero-carbon energy system. There is no one single solution to get us there. Instead, different regions face different challenges shaped by policies, energy infrastructure and resources, as well as by returns on investment and the life of their current assets. As an energy technology company, we shape the path to a sustainable energy system with innovative collaborations for new technologies and strategies. It’s time for partners across the whole energy landscape to put them into action.

Green hydrogen production
Electrolyzer for green hydrogen production in detail
Decarbonizing through green hydrogen
Green hydrogen (H2) is a versatile energy carrier that can be applied to decarbonize a wide range of sectors. It can be used directly or in the form of its derivatives like e-Methanol, e-Ammonia, or e-Fuels to replace fossil fuels like coal or gas.
Only around 40% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions originate from power generation which can be decarbonized via electrification. The other 60% of CO2 emissions originate from industry, mobility, buildings and others. These can be decarbonized via sector coupling, using green hydrogen and its derivatives to make renewable energy available to those sectors. This is why the production of sustainable hydrogen is so important for the energy transition.

Bringing Zero closer: Gas-insulated switchgear and busduct
With Zero F-gases and Zero harm, our Blue switchgear solutions make a greener grid achievable.
Why we need to go for Zero. And why you need Blue.
With the energy sector having a greater carbon impact than every other industry combined, the urgent need for decarbonization to combat climate change cannot be overstated. Renewable energy sources are only part of the solution; at Siemens Energy we understand how essential it is to achieve Zero Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the transmission of power as well as in its generation. Most switchgear still uses SF6 for insulation – a gas 24,300 times more climate-hostile than CO2 and one which stays in the atmosphere for up to 3,200 years. Even the new F-gas alternatives are still harmful to the environment when released. That’s not sustainable, as recognized by the new EU-F-gas-regulation. And it’s why we’ve developed our Zero-harm Blue portfolio, including gas-insulated switchgear and gas-insulated busduct. 
When traditional technology is still needed
While we are continuously striving for Zero, it is not yet possible for every voltage level. Thats why we still offer a range of high-performance traditional switchgear.
Go to our standard portfolio
Zero SF6, Zero greenhouse gases - only clean air
The only way to achieve Zero GWP and zero toxicity is by using clean air. Gas-insulated switchgear combine vacuum switching technology with clean air insulation. It operates with Zero harmful greenhouse gases of any kind, with Zero toxic decomposition products and Zero safety requirements during handling and maintenance.

HVDC PLUS®  addresses many of today's challenges to make the energy transition happen on a global scale. Its adoption not only signifies an important step towards achieving sustainability goals but also delivers tangible benefits ranging from operational efficiencies for TSOs to environmental conservation efforts benefiting society at large. As we continue to transition and seek ways to make our electrical transmission grids smarter and more resilient, embracing technologies like HVDC PLUS® will be key to energize society and create a more sustainable future for all.
Arrange a consultation
Fields of application
The answer to new challenges in AC grids & complex transmission systems
HVDC PLUS® technology is ideally suited to support and improve sustainability, efficiency, and reliability of electrical transmission grids. HVDC transmission systems supplement the existing AC grid and enable the following applications:
Most efficient for long-distance power transmission
Connecting remote renewable generation or remote loads to the interconnected AC grid for performance improvements
Integration of renewables & provision of energy trading capabilities
Embedded HVDC links in interconnected AC grids & large city center infeed
Providing fully controllable active & reactive power supply in both directions
Connection of asynchronous grids / grids with different frequencies and firewall against cascading blackouts
As a pioneer in HVDC technology, Siemens Energy provides a comprehensive portfolio of efficient and sustainable HVDC solutions in all fields of application for HVDC PLUS® technology.
HVDC PLUS® configurations
Symmetric Monopole
The HVDC PLUS® symmetric monopole configuration is a foundational design configuration in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems, characterized by its superior simplicity and reliability.
In this setup, the HVDC converter is connected with fully insulated DC conductors, operating at equal but opposite DC voltages to ground and offers the following main advantages:
This arrangement effectively reduces earth return currents, minimizing environmental impacts associated with ground currents.
As the transformers are not exposed to DC voltage stresses the sym. monopole configuration enables the use of standard AC power transformers.
No excessive infeed of fault currents from the AC grid at DC pole-ground faults.
Siemens Energy successfully scaled the sym. monopole configuration over the last decades. Pioneering HVDC PLUS® using MMC technology Siemens Energy is the world record holder for the highest max. DC voltage in sym. monopole configurations. 
Bipole
The bipole configurations represent a logical evolution and up-scaling in HVDC PLUS® technology which provides greater capacity and flexibility compared to symmetric monopole configurations.
There are three main types:
Bipole with Metallic Return (DMR): Utilizes a metallic path as return conductor, offering cost benefits by not requiring full insulation on the return path.
Bipole with Electrode: Uses earth or sea electrodes for returning current in case of (asym.) monopole operation due to maintenance or fault conditions.
Rigid Bipole: Consists of two conductors with opposite polarities and no metallic return or earth electrode return paths under normal operating conditions.
The bipole configuration incorporates  associated DC switchgear which allows for increased system redundancy allowing for continued operation even if one pole fails. Higher power transmission capabilities are facilitated accordingly. Rigid bipole configuration enables optimized CAPEX for long distance cable transmission systems.
Point-to-Point HVDC 
Point-to-point HVDC transmission involves two converter stations connecting two grid connection points directly using an DC transmission line in between.
This set-up is ideal for long-distance energy transmission between two specific locations using DC cable or DC OHL systems.
It's widely used for cross-border interconnections and connecting remote renewable energy sources to major consumption centers. Siemens Energy is the most experienced trusted partner to make cutting-edge and most reliable point-to-point HVDC transmission schemes a reality.
Back-to-Back
A back-to-back HVDC PLUS® system consists of two converter stations located in close proximity, usually within the same building, converting AC power from one network frequency directly into another network frequency via HVDC without any actual DC transmission line involved.
This setup is utilized primarily for connecting asynchronous electrical grids efficiently while also providing advanced control capabilities  for active & reactive power as well as AC voltage control.
Multiterminal HVDC
Multiterminal HVDC PLUS® systems build upon point-to-point concepts by incorporating more than two converter stations in a single integrated HVDC system with multiple converter stations and multiple DC transmission lines.
This enables more flexible and more complex power transmission opportunities such as collecting power from multiple generation sites (e.g., offshore wind farms, remote renewable energy sources) and distributing it across various load centers efficiently through strategic routing decisions made possible by advanced control systems inherent within specific and custom tailor-made multiterminal HVDC designs.
These set-ups enable  increased flexibility in integrating multiple renewable sources into a single integrated HVDC system enhancing grid efficiency and footprint. It allows for dynamic rerouting of energy based on generation and/or demand fluctuations ensuring optimal utilization of power resources available across regions.
A key component which facilitates these advanced capabilities of multiterminal HVDC systems is the converter technology used – specifically, half-bridge and full-bridge converters. Each offers unique advantages and characteristics suited to different operational / performance requirements.
Siemens Energy vast experience from 15 successfully executed point-to-point HVDC systems showcases the reliability and capability of Siemens  Energy as a most reliable  and most trusted partner in the industry making complex multiterminal HVDC systems a reality.
Siemens Energy leverages decades of HVDC expertise & modular multilevel converter technology to its fullest capabilities, applying half-bridge as well as full-bridge  converters. If required parallel converters can be used for increased power transmission capabilities and  provide superior redundancy and unmatched flexibility.
Have a closer look at the HVDC PLUS® symmetric monopole 3D experience
HVDC PLUS® features and benefits
Outstanding technological advantages for AC grid support 
Flexible and independent control of active and reactive power
Flexible AC voltage control to support weak AC networks

Enables multi-terminal HVDC systems
Reliable and robust performance down to short circuit ratio of zero
Versatile and suited for long-distance DC cable as well as DC OHL transmission lines
During AC transmission network restoration (e.g. after a widespread black-out), HVDC PLUS® can provide system recovery ancillary service (SRAS) to provide black-start capabilities
HVDC PLUS® MMC technology
The well-proven & established industry standard for VSC-based HVDC solutions
The Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) technology was first introduced to the market by Siemens Energy in 2007. It was successfully commissioned and put into commercial operation in 2010 with the pivotal pilot project Transbay Cable (San Francisco, USA).
Eventhough several other HVDC converter concepts were tested and trialed in the late 1990s/early 2000s all alternative HVDC converter concepts were abandoned & vanished from the HVDC market landscape.
Today MMC technology is the well-proven & established industry standard for VSC-based HVDC systems worldwide. Siemens Energy is the #1 market leader and trailblazer of MMC-based HVDC systems.

Industrial heat pumps are an efficient and cost-effective solution for the generation of heat and cold. They lift the temperature by absorbing thermal energy from an existing low-temperature heat source and releasing it to a warmer space. The use of a heat source (e.g., waste heat from industries or renewable heat from nature, like rivers or geothermal sources) enables heat pumps to generate much more heat with a certain amount of electricity, than a simple direct conversion of electric power to heat could do.

Gas-fired power plants fuel the energy transition
Gas-fired power plants can deliver a fast path to low-carbon energy systems today – plus, they can be fully decarbonized
The energy demand is rising. Growing economies, electrification and digitalization are driving the need for more power. At the same time, however, the world needs to respond to climate change. While renewable energy is increasing worldwide, there are still challenges in ensuring affordable, reliable, and sustainable power around the clock. This is where gas-fired power plants, usually operated as natural gas power plants, come in as a key energy transition strategy. 
Already today, gas-fired power plants generate 23 percent of the world’s electricity, providing essential services for the energy transition. They help replace coal and oil power, with new gas-fired power plants reducing CO2 emissions by up to 65 percent compared to existing coal plants and up to 60 percent compared to oil plants. Whether as peaker plants operating when there is high demand or as combined-cycle power plants (CCPPs) that add a steam turbine to generate up to 50 percent more electricity, gas-fired power plants step in on days with little or no sun or wind, producing much-needed residual load. They also stabilize the grid with their rotating masses, bringing ancillary services and resilience to the grid while supporting the expansion of solar and wind power. Moreover, gas-fired power plants can be fully decarbonized using sustainable fuels like hydrogen or carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). In short, gas turbines don’t just build a bridge to a decarbonized future – they are part of it. 
The replacement of a coal-fired plant with a gas-fired combined cycle power plant leads to a reduction of CO2 emissions by 65%
Whitepaper: Decarbonization pathways for gas turbines
Learn why gas turbines are urgently needed in the future energy landscape. What sustainable gaseous and liquid fuels are available for gas turbines. And how carbon capture technologies can be combined with gas turbines.

Benefits of natural gas power plants
There are several key reasons why natural gas power plants push the energy transition forward. Here are the three most important: Gas-fired power plants enable the coal phase-out, they stabilize grids for further renewable energy expansion, and they come with the potential to be fully decarbonized themselves.
1. Shifting away from coal and oil
One of the most effective, fast and cheap ways to reduce CO2 emissions in an economy is to replace coal or oil power with highly efficient natural gas power plants. When displacing an older coal plant, a new natural gas power plant can reduce CO2 emissions by between 60 and 65 percent. This is because natural gas has a lower carbon content than coal (between 45 and 50 percent lower) and today’s CCPPs have a much higher efficiency – 64 percent compared to around 40 percent in the case of older coal-fired power plants. Similar gains are made by replacing older oil-fired power plants: A new CCPP, for example, can reduce CO2 emissions by between 40 and 60 percent, depending on the efficiency of the oil-fired plant being replaced.  
What’s more, gas-fired power generation also offers greater operational flexibility. Natural gas plants can ramp up and down more quickly than coal plants, making them an ideal complement to intermittent renewable energy sources like wind and solar. 
As a technology leader in gas turbines, we are the partner of choice for both greenfield power plants and the conversion of existing coal-fired power plants into highly efficient CCPPs. This approach not only reduces CO2 emissions by up to 65 percent, it also reduces capital expenditure (Capex) by up to 30 percent. 
Since 2010, the switch from coal to gas has already saved around 500 million tons of CO2. This is equivalent to putting an extra 200 million electric vehicles on the road in the same period. 
Leaving coal behind: Stadtwerke Leipzig, Germany
Municipal energy supplier Stadtwerke Leipzig wanted to break away from coal-based power and heat to provide the city with entirely climate-neutral heating by 2038. But they needed a solution flexible enough to offset fluctuations in renewables and quickly respond to changing spot market demands.
They opted for a combined heat and power plant with two SGT-800 turbines. Already capable of running on 30 percent hydrogen, the plant’s turbines are pre-equipped for retrofitting, making them 100 percent hydrogen-ready. Operating now on natural gas, they’ll gradually make the switch to hydrogen over the next few years, when the fuel becomes available and competitive.

2. Rotating turbine masses enable renewables integration
Yes, expanding wind and solar power reduces generation costs and CO2 emissions, but it also comes with two major challenges. They are not available 24/7. And they do not provide grid stability.  
When there is no wind or sun, natural gas power plants can provide dispatchable power. While demand-side management (DSM) and energy storage solutions such as batteries or pumped hydropower can also reduce residual load demands, they usually only work for a matter of hours. Gas turbines are crucial to covering residual loads for longer periods of time. And eventually gas turbines running on green hydrogen produced from surplus renewable energy will enable a closed loop for deep decarbonization of electricity production. 
Traditionally, the stability and resilience of our power grids comes from conventional power plants with synchronous generators that supply indispensable grid ancillary services, like inertia, voltage control and provision of short-circuit power. In most cases, renewable energy cannot provide these services, but the rotating masses of turbine generator sets can, adding rotating inertia, stabilizing power grid voltage levels with reactive power, and strengthening the system with short-circuit power. As more large coal-fired power plants are retired, gas-fired plants will need to provide these ancillary grid services.  
With an optional synchronous condenser mode, generators can remain connected to the grid year-round, even if the gas or steam turbine (in a CCPP) isn’t providing active power. A flywheel can also be added to increase inertia. The more inertia these rotating masses give to the grid, the more renewables can be connected, pushing the boundaries of renewable energy penetration.  
Keeping it stable: Moneypoint, Ireland
Irish energy company ESB wanted to transform the country’s last coal-fired power plant Moneypoint Power Station into a green energy hub for the future, including offshore wind farms and green hydrogen production. The critical first step was the installation of a Siemens Energy synchronous condenser with the world’s largest flywheel. Together they provide essential inertia and reactive power to help integrate renewable energy into Ireland's grid once its coal-fired turbines are shut down.

3. Natural gas power plants can be decarbonized
While natural gas-fired power plants are a cleaner, better choice than coal plants in terms of emissions, they still run on fossil fuels. This is the case for now, but the industry is setting the stage for a decarbonized future. This can be done either through the use of sustainable fuels or through carbon capture and storage (CCS).  
For example, green hydrogen produced from renewable energy offers huge potential to decarbonize the power sector. And other forms of sustainable hydrogen, classified by color, such as blue, turquoise or pink hydrogen, to indicate production methods, can help decarbonize residual power with gas turbines. Already today, we make turbines capable of operating on hydrogen as well as hydrogen-ready power plants that are pre-equipped for a later retrofit to 100 percent hydrogen. Other sustainable fuels that could be used in the future include biofuels produced from organic matter or hydrogen derivatives like ammonia or methanol. 
Alternatively, CCS is increasingly recognized as a method that can help electricity production reach close to net zero. CCS can be paired with gas turbines as well as coal and biomass power plants to remove CO2 emissions from flue gas. With strategic partnerships, we are driving the development of CCS and CCUS technologies to intercept greenhouse gases where they are generated. 
Local conditions will ultimately determine which decarbonization technology is the most suitable and economical for a given project.  
Paving the way for hydrogen: Hillabee, US
Constellation Energy, the United States’ foremost clean energy producer, achieved a record for hydrogen by co-firing a 38 percent blend of hydrogen with natural gas in an SGT6-6000G gas turbine at their Hillabee power plant in Alabama during a test in the spring of 2023. In a commercial application, this blend rate would reduce the plant’s carbon emissions by approximately 270,000 metric tons annually. Constellation is aiming to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040.

Gas power’s decarbonization in action
Gas turbines are a tool for many parts of the energy transition. They’re efficiency giants, especially when used in a CCPP. They have the ability to step in and provide residual power in a system where renewables come first, and they can stabilize the grid with ancillary services provided through the generator or a synchronous condenser. In case of a blackout, gas turbines can quickly restart the grid. And they provide a bridge to a fully decarbonized electricity production with the use of sustainable fuels or CCS technology.
Highly efficient gas turbines
Our advanced turbines are engineered to deliver exceptional efficiency for natural gas power plants, with world-class fast cold start and hot restart capabilities. Models like the SGT5-9000HL achieve combined cycle efficiencies exceeding 64 percent, significantly reducing fuel consumption and emissions.  
Explore our gas turbine portfolio
CCPPs and CHPs
Our CCPPs maximize energy output while minimizing fuel consumption and emissions. They can also cogenerate heat for industrial steam or district heating demand, supporting the global transition to sustainable energy solutions. For instance, the SGT-800 gas turbine is ideal for combined cycle or cogeneration installations with its excellent efficiency and outstanding steam-raising capability.

Driving the decarbonization of industry on an industrial scale
We help industrial companies significantly reduce their carbon footprint
Decarbonizing industry
The industrial sector is responsible for 30% of global emissions. An annual CO2 reduction of over five gigatons is needed. However, we can enable our customers to cut emissions through new technologies and greater energy efficiency.
Making progress with our customers
Our technologies are transforming transportation. Together with Norwegian shipbuilder Fjellstrand, we have helped build the world’s first battery-powered car and passenger ferry. The owner Norled will reduce fuel costs by up to 60% and avoid 300,000 tons of CO2 emissions compared to conventional ferries.
"The decarbonized future is emerging. It leads to the modernization of industry, bears the chance of competitiveness, and, thus, creates and ensures jobs."
Anne-Laure de Chammard, Member of the Executive Board, Siemens Energy
Specific challenges and solutions
Our focus is on two areas:
Conversion processes
Industrial emissions can be significantly lowered through improved energy efficiency. By upgrading power equipment our customers already have installed, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Wherever possible, we implement direct electrification, since this is the most efficient use of energy and avoids emissions incurred in conversion processes.
Hydrogen infrastructure
In circumstances where direct electrification is not possible, we are driving forward the use of hydrogen infrastructure. Hydrogen will play a central role in the decarbonization of the shipping and aviation industries, as well as in industrial processes where it can be used directly in its chemical form.
Energy transition targets
We have definite aims for the decarbonization of industry:
Increasing production capacity for hydrogen technologies, including the development of a gigawatt-scale facility for manufacturing electrolyzers in Berlin
Supporting our partners in increasing fuel efficiency, through super-efficient gas turbines, performance enhancement solutions and hydrogen co-firing upgrades
To be the leading provider of carbon-reducing solutions for industry

A material necessity: securing the energy supply chain
We’ve taken the steps to secure the materials needed
Rising costs, changing circumstances
Expanding renewable energy requires huge quantities of minerals and raw materials. Power generation units now need 50% more minerals than in 2010. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have also pushed up the price of raw materials.
Making progress with our partners
During the energy crisis largely precipitated by the war in Ukraine, we were able to almost offset the rise in raw material prices in many areas. We will continue to work on reducing to a minimum the number of suppliers where there is a risk of disruption.
“
Procurement's major shifts, fueled by demand for resilience, sustainability, growth enablement and new technologies, provide a competitive edge to organizations that can address these challenges.
Juha Pankakoski
Executive Vice President, Global Functions
Specific challenges and solutions
  In an uncertain world, it is vital that we diversify our supply chains and reduce our dependency on any particular source of raw materials. Our strategy involves:
The regionalization and expansion of supply chains.
Securing availability and prices through long-term contracts.
Energy transition targets
Every supply chain has an objective.  Our focus on the supply chain has two:
To make it more resilient by increasing levels of sustainability, transparency and accountability
Reduce dependencies by diversifying our supply chains. We at Siemens Energy pursues a strategy of regionalization and expansion of supply chains
  Recognizing and rating the risks
The Siemens Energy sustainability risk analysis system continuously identifies potential risks in the supply chain, using information from internationally recognized organizations.

Cross-industry applications helping to master the energy transitions
The energy landscape is currently undergoing a radical transformation. The world needs a more diversified energy mix and a massive expansion of renewable energies – along with corresponding infrastructure, and storage capacities to meet the growing demand for electrical power and heat.
While many industries require tailored approaches that complement their processes, there are selected technologies that can be applied in several industries, e.g., hydrogen applications. And others, like digital or storage solutions, are applicable to many, if not the majority of industrial sectors.
All of these technologies support and drive the energy transition and the goal to make energy reliable, affordable and sustainable. As a global leader in energy technology, we are committed to  supporting our customers  to reduce their carbon footprint and achieve their sustainability goals, and to build a greener, more resilient future.

Shaping a new energy world with storage solutions
To fight climate change we need carbon neutral energy production and distribution.
Shaping a new energy world with storage solutions
To fight climate change we need carbon neutral energy production and distribution.
  For that, renewables such as wind and solar are key. But their supply fluctuates – and still, energy demand has to be met, and the grid has to operate reliably and economically.
While today’s energy producers respond to grid fluctuations by mainly relying on fossil-fired power plants, energy storage solutions will take on a dominant role in fulfilling this need in the future, supplying renewable energy 24/7. It’s already taking shape today – and in the coming years it will become a more and more indispensable and flexible part of our new energy world.

Sport-Tuned — Front and Rear — Available FOX™ Dual-Live Valve Shocks
Ford F-150® Raptor® models offer available FOX Dual-Live Valve internal bypass shocks with state-of-the-art electronic control technology. They provide position-sensitive damping adjustability designed to better resist heat buildup and to react quickly to terrain changes for greater confidence over extended desert running. The larger, anodized aluminum shock bodies are filled with low-friction shock fluid specially formulated to decrease frictional losses inside the damper for improved off- and on-road comfort. Electronically controlled base valves are race-proven — with an upgraded design enabling upward of 1,000 pounds of damping per corner at high desert speeds.

Vehicle Details
Your Handbook to Hitch and Haul
You need to move big stuff. Learn how to find a Ford with just the right towing capacity. Explore the equipment you’ll need. And even make sense of GVWRs, GCVWRs, and GAWRs.
Find Your Best Fit
We make plenty of cargo-capable trucks and SUVs. With a few short questions, let’s find the ones just right for your needs.
How much weight do you expect to tow or haul? Select your vehicle needs by combining the weight of your trailer, your cargo, passengers, and gear.
Up to 3,500 lbs (Pop-Up Camper, Trailer for a Jet Ski or a Small Boat)
